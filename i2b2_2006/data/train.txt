and O
has O
been O
on O

. O

On O
the O
day O
she O
was O
seen O
for O
her O
regular O
office O
evaluation O
and O
treatment O
, O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
very O
slightly O
confused O
, O
nauseated O
, O
vomiting O
, O
and O
dehydrated O
. O

Laboratory O
studies O
were O
obtained O

administered O
on O
01/30 B-DATE

and O
she O
was O
started O
on O
Fragmin O
and O
Coumadin O
during O
this O

will O
be O
continued O
as O
an O
outpatient O
until O
the O
Coumadin O
dose O
is O
established O
and O
then O
this O

was O
felt O
that O
this O
response O
and O
the O
presentation O
raised O
a O
definite O
question O
of O
symptomatic O

hydrocephalus O
, O
but O
that O
this O
could O
not O
be O
diagnosed O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
unit O
and O
experienced O
some O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
with O
minimal O
EKG O
changes O
. O

He O
became O
tachycardic O
to O
the O
rate O
of O
110 O
, O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
128 O
to O
130 O
. O

He O
was O
pain O
free O
with O
EKG O
ST O
depressions O
laterally O
. O

Around O
4:00 O
p.m. O
this O
occurred O
and O
he O
was O
given O
a O
beta O
blocker O
2.5 O
mg O
IV O
push O
times O
four O
. O

His O
heart O
rate O
went O
down O
to O
60 O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
he O
was O
also O
given O
25 O
mg O
po O
of O
Lopressor O
. O

Later O
, O
within O
an O
half O
hour O
the O
blood O
pressure O
dipped O
into O
the O
70s O
systolic O
, O
and O
IV O
fluid O
was O
started O
. O

He O
complained O
of O
continued O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
. O

He O
was O
given O
Compazine O
PR O
and O
was O
started O
on O
Dopamine O
and O
then O
Dobutamine O
was O
added O
when O
that O
did O
not O
appear O
sufficient O
to O
increase O
his O
blood O
pressure O
above O
80 O
. O

He O
had O
a O
good O
urinary O
output O
. O

His O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
was O
then O
in O
the O
100 O
to O
110 O
range O
and O
at O
that O
time O
his O
IV O
fluids O
were O
decreased O
. O

However O
, O
acutely O
at O
around O
8:00 O
p.m. O
the O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
plummeted O
down O
to O
60 O
to O
70 O
and O
at O
this O
time O
a O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
done O
which O
showed O
moderate O
CHF O
. O

The O
patient O
complained O
of O
pain O
between O
his O
shoulder O
blades O
and O
at O
this O
time O
IV O
fluid O
was O
increased O
, O
so O
was O
the O
Dopamine O
and O
Dobutamine O
. O

On O
the O
above O
chest O
x-ray O
no O
evidence O
of O
dissection O
was O
noted O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
pressors O
, O
heart O
rate O
dropped O
into O
the O
50s O
. O

Atropine O
X O
2 O
amps O
were O
given O
and O
the O
heart O
rate O
was O
in O
the O
60s O
with O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
remaining O
in O
the O
80 O
to O
90 O
range O
by O
Doppler O
. O

Oxygen O
saturations O
at O
this O
time O
were O
greater O
than O
90% O
on O
100% O
breather O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
intubated O
and O
prior O
to O
intubation O
his O
rhythm O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
in O
the O
low O
junctional O
vs. O
accelerated O
idioventricular O
pattern O
. O

Surgery O
at O
this O
time O
was O
consulted O
and O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
an O
operable O
candidate O
so O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
not O
to O
place O
an O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
. O

Central O
access O
was O
gained O
and O
a O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
done O
which O
showed O
no O
pnuemothorax O
and O
his O
central O
line O
was O
in O
good O
placement O
as O
well O
as O
NG O
tube O
. O

He O
was O
still O
in O
some O
CHF O
, O
mild O
to O
moderate O
. O

Atropine O
one O
amp O
was O
given O
. O

At O
this O
time O
the O
decision O
to O
cardiovert O
the O
patient O
was O
made O
and O
he O
was O
cardioverted O
at O
40 O
joules O
without O
significant O
change O
. O

There O
was O
a O
question O
of O
fleeting O
T O
waves O
that O
were O
noted O
briefly O
but O
could O
not O
be O
observed O
on O
12 O
lead O
EKG O
. O

At O
this O
time O
1 O
mg O
of O
Glucagon O
IV O
was O
given O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
reversing O
any O
remnant O
of O
beta O
blocker O
effect O
and O
a O
pacer O
wire O
was O
introduced O
through O
the O
central O
access O
with O
only O
fleeting O
capture O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
blood O
pressure O
continued O
to O
fall O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
no O
longer O
responsive O
. O

The O
rhythm O
began O
to O
degenerate O
into O
an O
agonal O
rhythm O
and O
a O
code O
was O
finally O
called O
at O
9:18 O
p.m. O

The O
patient O
was O
without O
respirations O
or O
blood O
pressure O
. O

The O
family O
was O
notified O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
code O
and O
about O
the O
time O
of O
placement O
of O
central O
access O
and O
spoken O
to O
again O
once O
the O
code O
was O
called O
. O

Autopsy O
was O
requested O
, O
however O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
will O
not O
give O
us O
their O
decision O
until O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

Mr. O

grafting O
procedure O
in O
March B-DATE
, O
1990 O
, O
following O
a O
complicated O
inferior O
posterior O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

He O
had O
a O
very O
stormy O
course O
, O
dominated O
by O
post O
infarction O
angina O

atrial O
ventricular O
block O
, O
gastrointestinal O
bleeding O
, O
pneumonia O
, O
and O
no O
noliguric O
renal O
failure O
. O

An O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
was O
required O
for O
stabilization O
. O

He O
also O
had O
moderately O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis O
at O
that O
time O
with O
a O
peak O
aortic O
valve O
gradient O
of O
30 O
, O
and O
a O
calculated O
valve O
area O
of O
1.2 O
cm O
squared O
. O

Despite O
the O
magnitude O
of O
these O
problems O
, O
he O
made O
a O
remarkable O
recovery O
over O
the O
course O
of O
several O
months O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
return O
to O
work O
on O
a O
part-time O
basis O
, O
after O
joining O
a O
program O
of O
cardiac O
rehabilitation O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
we O
measured O
a O
left O
ventricle O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
40% O
, O
by O
gated O
cardiac O
blood O
pool O
scanning O
. O

Over O
these O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
he O
has O
remained O
stable O
, O
on O
a O
very O
simple O
program O
of O
aspirin O
, O
and O
Atenolol O
. O

He O
returned O
for O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Medical O
Service O
, O
and O
placed O
at O
bed O
rest O
, O
and O
given O
intravenous O
Furosemide O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
we O
succeeded O
in O
having O
his O
weight O
decrease O
from O
its O
value O
of O
189 O
lbs O
, O
to O
as O

. O

Coincident O
with O
this O
, O
his O
clinical O
condition O
improved O
markedly O
, O
and O
he O
became O
fully O
ambulatory O
. O

Given O
the O
difficulties O
in O
trying O
to O
assess O
the O
exact O
mechanism O
by O
which O
his O
heart O
failure O
had O
occurred O
, O
we O
proceeded O
to O
cardiac O
catheterization O
on O
4/1 B-DATE
93 O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
study O
, O
the O
right O

was O
1 O
, O
the O
PA O
pressure O
32/10 O
, O
and O
the O
mean O
pulmonary O
capillary O

There O
was O
a O
40-50 O
mm O
peak O
to O
peak O
gradient O
across O
the O
aortic O
valve O
, O
a O
mean O

, O
and O
a O
calculated O
valve O
area O
of O
0.5 O
cm O
squared O
, O
using O
a O
cardiac O
output O
of O
3.4 O
liters O

. O

Left O
ventriculography O
demonstrated O
marked O
left O
ventricle O
dilatation O
. O

There O
was O
mild O
mitral O
regurgitation O
, O
a O
posterior O
basil O
aneurysm O
, O
and O
akinesis O
of O
the O
apex O
, O
septum O
, O
and O
inferior O
walls O
. O

The O
anterior O
lateral O
wall O
was O
severely O
hypokinetic O
, O
and O
the O
posterior O
lateral O
wall O
moderately O
kinetic O
. O

The O
aortic O
valve O
was O
calcified O
with O
reduced O
excursion O
consistent O
with O
his O
aortic O
stenosis O
. O

A O
dominant O
right O
coronary O
artery O
had O
an O
80% O
proximal O
stenosis O
, O
and O
was O
then O
occluded O
at O
the O
acute O
margin O
. O

A O
large O
right O
ventricular O
marginal O
branch O
did O
fill O
the O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
in O
a O
retrograde O
fashion O
. O

The O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
had O
an O
80% O
stenosis O
proximal O
to O
the O
insertion O
of O
the O
graft O
. O

The O
left O
anterior O
descending O
was O
proximally O
occluded O
, O
and O
the O
left O
circumflex O
had O
a O
90% O
stenosis O
in O
the O
first O
marginal O
branch O
, O
and O
90% O
stenosis O
distally O
in O
other O
branches O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
the O
right O
ventricular O
acute O
marginal O
and O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
was O
patent O
with O
good O
runoff O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
had O
a O
minor O
plaque O
at O
the O
distal O
anastomosis O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
three O
distal O
marginal O
branches O
was O
patent O
with O
good O
flow O
. O

Certainly O
, O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
was O
consistent O
with O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
profound O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
dysfunction O
. O

These O
findings O
were O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
Patella B-DOCTOR
and O
together O
we O
decided O
that O
conservative O
therapy O
would O
be O
the O
appropriate O
first O
choice O
in O
Mr. O
Breun B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
management O
. O

His O
advanced O
age O
, O
prior O
cardiac O
surgery O
and O
advanced O
left O
ventricular O
dysfunction O
, O
together O
with O
his O
chronic O
renal O
insufficiency O
, O
would O
certainly O
complicate O
to O
an O
enormous O
degree O
any O
undertaking O
as O
risky O
as O
redo O
surgery O
for O
aortic O
valve O
replacement O
. O

Percutaneous O
aortic O
valvuloplasty O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
would O
only O
be O
a O
temporary O
procedure O
and O
did O
not O
seem O
necessary O
even O
for O
transient O
symptomatic O
relief O
given O
his O
marked O
improvement O
following O
a O
rather O
conventional O
course O
of O
intravenous O
diuretics O
. O

It O
is O
very O
unlikely O
that O
we O
will O
offer O
Mr. O
Breun B-PATIENT
aortic O
valve O
replacement O
surgery O
in O
the O
future O
. O

He O
seems O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
particular O
approach O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
has O
become O
very O
important O
and O
appropriate O
issue O
for O
him O
. O

He O
is O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O
home O
and O
going O
back O
to O
work O
on O
a O
part O
time O
basis O
at O
the O
local O
pharmacy O
. O

We O
will O
see O
how O
far O
we O
can O
get O
with O
medical O
therapy O
although O
Mr. O
Wierst B-DOCTOR
and O
his O
family O
clearly O
understand O
the O
long O
term O
implications O
of O
his O
aortic O
stenosis O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
then O
Neurologic O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

On O
admission O
, O
he O
was O
difficult O
to O
arouse O
and O
there O
was O
a O
large O
volume O
of O
heme O
aspirate O
per O
nasogastric O

showed O
a O
5.3 O

4 O
cm. O
hematoma O
involving O
the O
basilar O
ganglion O
. O

The O
medial O
region O
of O
the O
hematoma O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
suspicious O
for O
tumor O
versus O
arteriovenous O
malformation O
. O

There O
was O
no O
enhancement O
seen O
in O
the O

, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
metastatic O
work O
up O
which O
included O
a O
computerized O

scan O
of O
the O
chest O
which O
initially O
suggested O
a O
left O
hilar O
mass O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
up O
with O
a O
bronchoscopy O
and O
transbronchial O
biopsy O
was O

. O

A O

did O
not O
show O
the O
mass O
initially O
noted O
. O

A O
cerebral O
angiogram O
of O
the O
left O
coronary O
artery O
was O
performed O
and O
unremarkable O
except O
for O
mass O
effect O
from O
the O
hematoma O
. O

A O
testicular O
ultrasound O
was O
performed O
and O
was O
negative O
for O
mass O
. O

An O
esophagogastroduodenoscopy O
was O
performed O
and O
G-tube O
was O
performed O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

There O
was O
no O
specific O
gastritis O
and O
inflammation O
noted O
in O
the O
bulb O
and O
duodenum O
. O

An O
abdominal O
and O
pelvic O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
was O
performed O
and O
revealed O
a O
7 O
mm. O
hypodensity O
in O
the O
lateral O
left O
lobe O
of O
the O
liver O
which O
was O
non-enhancing O
. O

The O
GI O
Service O
was O
consulted O
on O
this O
mass O
and O
suggested O
an O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
of O
the O
liver O
. O

This O
confirmed O
an O
8 O
mm. O
mass O
which O
was O
bright O
on O
T2 O
and O
homogeneous O
in O
the O
right O
lateral O
segment O
and O
medial O
lobe O
of O
the O
liver O
, O
which O
was O
consistent O
with O
a O
benign O
hemangioma O
or O
cyst O
. O

The O
urine O
cytology O
was O
negative O
for O
malignant O
cells O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
drowsy O
until O
Decadron O
was O
added O
to O
his O
medical O
regimen O
. O

He O
awoke O
significantly O
after O
that O
with O
increased O
alertness O
, O
ability O
to O
interact O
with O
his O
environment O
and O
follow O
commands O
. O

He O
has O
slowly O
made O
progress O
with O
increased O
strength O
on O
the O
right O
side O
and O
ability O
to O
walk O
with O
assistance O
. O

He O
was O
started O
on O
Dexedrine O
because O
there O
was O
a O
question O
of O
whether O
some O
component O
of O
his O
lethargy O
could O
be O
depression O
. O

This O
seemed O
to O
help O
him O
remarkably O
with O
increased O
activity O
. O

His O
Decadron O
has O
been O
tapered O
slowly O
to O
zero O
and O
his O
examination O
on O
discharge O
was O
as O
follows O
: O

He O
still O
spends O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
bed O
, O
although O
easily O
arousable O
. O

He O
needs O
persistent O
persuasion O
to O
increase O
his O
activity O
and O
was O
oriented O
to O
person O
, O
place O
, O
but O
not O
date O
. O

Speech O
was O
nonfluent O
with O
occasional O
single O
words O
. O

He O
sleeps O
with O
a O
hypophonia O
, O
but O
occasionally O
will O
speak O
louder O
when O
he O
is O
in O
better O
spirits O
. O

He O
followed O
all O
commands O
readily O
. O

His O
pupils O
were O
equal O
and O
reactive O
from O
4 O
to O
2 O
mm O
. O

There O
was O
some O
breakdown O
in O
saccads O
to O
smooth O
pursuit O
. O

He O
had O
limited O
vertical O
up O
gaze O
. O

He O
still O
had O
a O
significant O
right O
central O
facial O
droop O
. O

His O
gag O
was O
intact O
with O
palatal O
movements O
. O

On O
repetitive O
testing O
with O
Speech O
Therapy O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
swallow O
in O
a O
safe O
manner O
. O

Thus O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
be O
nothing O
by O
mouth O
and O
on O
tube O
feeds O
. O

He O
squints O
with O
his O
left O
eye O
when O
he O
tries O
to O
focus O
and O
claims O
this O
is O
because O
he O
sees O
double O
. O

He O
had O
approximately O
4+ O
to O
5/5 O
strength O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
and O
lower O
extremities O
. O

His O
left O
side O
was O
full O
. O

He O
had O
marked O
dysmetria O
bilaterally O
, O
but O
left O
greater O
than O
right O
to O
finger O
to O
nose O
and O
his O
gait O
was O
very O
ataxic O
. O

His O
deep O
tendon O
reflexes O
revealed O
slight O
hyper O
reflexia O
on O
the O
right O
with O
3 O
right O
brachial O
radialis O
, O
triceps O
, O
biceps O
and O

HE O
had O
an O

toe O
. O

On O
the O
left O
, O
his O
reflexes O
wee O
2-2+ O
with O
a O
downgoing O
toe O
. O

He O
had O
right O
clonus O
, O
which O
was O
sustained O
. O

A O
head O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
was O
repeated O
on O
08/08 B-DATE
92 O
which O
revealed O
some O
resolution O
of O
blood O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
mass O
behind O
the O
hematoma O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
with O
his O
weight O
loss O
, O
that O
this O
needs O
to O
be O
relooked O
at O
in O
one O
month O
. O

Thus O
, O
he O
should O
return O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

This O
extremely O
complex O
75 O
year O
old O
woman O
was O
admitted O
from O
an O
outside O
hospital O
with O
fever O
. O

She O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
6/15 B-DATE
93 O
when O
she O
began O
to O
experience O
intermittent O
confusion O
, O
diarrhea O
, O
and O
fevers O
up O
to O
104 O
, O
associated O
with O
chills O
. O

There O
were O
transient O
mental O
status O
changes O
but O
no O
convulsions O
or O
loss O
of O
consciousness O
. O

She O
was O
also O
noted O
to O
have O
some O
diarrhea O
at O
this O
time O
. O

Because O
of O
increasing O
mental O
status O
changes O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
O B-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
in O
Sondibrid B-LOCATION
Ey I-LOCATION
on O
6/20 B-DATE
, O
and O
she O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
gram-positive O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
, O
high O
fever O
, O
and O
was O
started O
on O
Ciprofloxacin O
. O

Blood O
cultures O
drawn O
on O
admission O
showed O
multiple O
organisms O
including O
Clostridium O
perfringens O
, O
coagulase O
negative O
Staph O
, O
and O
alpha O
hemolytic O
Streptococcus O
. O

Her O
antibiotics O
were O
appropriately O
changed O
. O

At O
the O
family O
&apos;s O
request O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Heaonboburg B-HOSPITAL
Linpack I-HOSPITAL

for O
further O
evaluation O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Further O
evaluation O
at O
Heaonboburg B-HOSPITAL
Linpack I-HOSPITAL
Grant I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
, O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
mitral O
valve O
endocarditis O
with O
mitral O
regurgitation O
that O
was O
initially O
managed O
medically O
. O

Her O
antibiotics O
were O
appropriately O
adjusted O
because O
of O
the O
polymicrobial O
nature O
. O

Cardiac O
echo O
showed O
that O
she O
had O
moderate O
mitral O
regurgitation O
, O
an O
enlarged O
left O
atrium O
, O
and O
good O
ventricular O
function O
. O

There O
was O
a O
suggestion O
of O
mitral O
valve O
vegetation O
. O

She O
was O
placed O
on O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
with O
gradual O
decrease O
in O
her O
temperature O
, O
although O
some O
low O
grade O
temperatures O
initially O
persisted O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an O
extensive O
evaluation O
over O
the O
days O
that O
followed O
in O
order O
to O
find O
potential O
sources O
. O

She O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
Gynecology O
Service O
including O
the O
performance O
of O
a O
pelvic O
ultrasound O
and O
also O
by O
the O
GI O
Service O
where O
she O
underwent O
a O
barium O
enema O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
GI O
or O
pelvic O
disease O
which O
would O
account O
for O
the O
bacterial O
source O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
she O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
Sileyer B-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
and O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
active O
dental O
infection O
. O

She O
had O
a O
cerebral O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
performed O
and O
there O
was O
evidence O
of O
stroke O
. O

Because O
of O
her O
complex O
picture O
, O
and O
because O
the O
source O
of O
her O
sepsis O
was O
not O
found O
, O
the O
initial O
plan O
was O
to O
treat O
with O
antibiotics O
and O
hopefully O
obtain O
a O
completely O
sterile O
surgical O
field O
for O
subsequent O
valve O
replacement O
, O
if O
indicated O
. O

Her O
temperature O
became O
low O
grade O
and O
it O
was O
initially O
stable O
with O
her O
mitral O
regurgitation O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
June B-DATE
, O
she O
had O
become O
afebrile O
and O
the O
initial O
plan O
was O
to O
complete O
a O
full O
course O
of O
antibiotics O
to O
obtain O
a O
sterile O
surgical O
field O
. O

A O
rash O
developed O
and O
antibiotics O
were O
appropriately O
changed O
and O
antibiotic O
levels O
were O
optimized O
. O

On O
7/13 B-DATE
, O
she O
developed O
a O
sudden O
episode O
of O
pulmonary O
edema O
that O
resolved O
quickly O
and O
she O
was O
thought O
to O
have O
possible O
worsening O
of O
her O
mitral O
regurgitation O
. O

She O
was O
moved O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
and O
underwent O
subsequent O
cardiac O
catheterization O
in O
preparation O
for O
possible O
surgery O
. O

Her O
cardiac O
catheterization O
demonstrated O
minor O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
and O
severe O
mitral O
regurgitation O
with O
a O
suggestion O
of O
an O
annular O
abscess O
. O

After O
considerable O
discussion O
among O
the O
physicians O
involved O
in O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
care O
, O
it O
had O
become O
apparent O
that O
the O
mitral O
regurgitation O
had O
worsened O
. O

Also O
, O
no O
source O
for O
sepsis O
had O
been O
found O
. O

Because O
of O
worsening O
mitral O
regurgitation O
, O
and O
the O
findings O
of O
severe O
mitral O
regurgitation O
at O
cardiac O
catheterization O
, O
as O
well O
as O
elevated O
filling O
pressures O
, O
it O
was O
everyone O
&apos;s O
opinion O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
not O
wait O
to O
complete O
a O
long O
course O
of O
antibiotics O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
she O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
7/21 B-DATE
93 O
. O

During O
her O
cardiac O
procedure O
, O
she O
sustained O
dissection O
of O
the O
ascending O
aorta O
. O

She O
, O
therefore O
, O
underwent O
graft O
replacement O
of O
her O
ascending O
aorta O
and O
mitral O
valve O
replacement O
. O

Her O
valve O
was O
excised O
and O
any O
material O
that O
appeared O
infected O
was O
debrided O
. O

It O
was O
possible O
to O
clean O
the O
area O
thoroughly O
and O
it O
also O
became O
apparent O
that O
there O
was O
evidence O
of O
calcification O
in O
and O
around O
the O
annulus O
consistent O
with O
prior O
rheumatic O
fever O
. O

Her O
valve O
was O
replaced O
with O
a O
St. O
Jude O
Medical O
mitral O
prosthesis O
and O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
place O
the O
valve O
securely O
. O

She O
weaned O
from O
cardiopulmonary O
bypass O
with O
hemodynamics O
consistent O
with O
extreme O
vasodilation O
, O
and O
she O
required O
enormous O
doses O
of O
vasoconstrictors O
to O
maintain O
her O
blood O
pressure O
. O

She O
was O
bleeding O
after O
operation O
with O
her O
picture O
also O
consistent O
with O
coagulopathy O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
picture O
suggested O
the O
effects O
of O
systemic O
sepsis O
. O

In O
the O
early O
postoperative O
period O
, O
she O
had O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
, O
possibly O
related O
to O
compression O
from O
her O
lungs O
, O
as O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
elevated O
inspiratory O
pressures O
on O
the O
ventilator O
. O

The O
sternum O
was O
reopened O
with O
improvement O
in O
her O
hemodynamics O
and O
additional O
stability O
. O

She O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
07/22 B-DATE
and O
underwent O
mediastinal O
exploration O
, O
removal O
of O
some O
mediastinal O
clot O
, O
and O
by O
now O
, O
hemostasis O
had O
improved O
. O

Her O
sternum O
was O
left O
opened O
and O
the O
skin O
wound O
was O
left O
opened O
, O
using O
an O
elastic O
membrane O
to O
close O
the O
chest O
. O

With O
clotting O
factor O
replacement O
, O
bleeding O
gradually O
abated O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
problem O
. O

She O
subsequently O
developed O
ongoing O
manifestations O
of O
sepsis O
with O
sustained O
vasodilation O
and O
developed O
anuric O
renal O
failure O
which O
required O
peritoneal O
dialysis O
. O

She O
remained O
on O
full O
support O
in O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
on O
dialysis O
, O
with O
ongoing O
evidence O
of O
acidosis O
. O

Despite O
full O
support O
on O
multiple O
, O
high O
dose O
inotropic O
and O
vasoconstrictor O
agents O
, O
her O
clinical O
status O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
and O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
her O
prognosis O
was O
extremely O
poor O
. O

After O
consultation O
with O
the O
family O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
not O
resuscitate O
her O
and O
, O
with O
continued O
deterioration O

received O
his O
bone O

complicated O
by O
fevers O
and O
neutropenia O
which O
were O
treated O
with O
antibiotics O
and O
a O
diffuse O
erythroderm O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
drug O
reaction O
. O

On O
06/24 B-DATE
00 O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
have O

blood O
found O
in O
the O
upper O

no O
evidence O
of O
blood O
in O

change O
in O
mental O
status O
and O
increased O
respiratory O
distress O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
intubated O

It O
was O
felt O
at O
that O
time O
that O
the O
changing O
mental O
status O
and O
respiratory O
distress O
might O
be O
due O
to O
a O

of O
medication O
and O
worsening O

. O

Although O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
pain O
and O

he O
continued O
to O
be O
agitated O

00 O
and O
it O
revealed O
an O

hemorrhage O
. O

Neurosurgery O

due O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
bleed O
surgery O
was O
not O
considered O
an O
option O
. O

The O
patient O
gradually O
lost O

and O
was O
pronounced O
dead O

BRIEF O
RESUME O
OF O
HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Patient O
is O
an O
80 O
year O
old O
female O
with O
a O
history O
of O
dementia O
, O
and O
of O
a O
choreoathetotic O
movement O
disorder O
of O
unclear O
etiology O
. O

She O
has O
had O
these O
problems O
for O
approximately O
10 O
years O
, O
and O
is O
cared O
for O
by O
a O
family O
member O
. O

W O
/ O
U O
for O
Huntington O
&apos;s O
, O
ceruloplasmin O
, O
TSH O
, O
etc O
have O
all O
been O
negative O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Now O
presents O
with O
report O
of O
sub-acute O
worsening O
of O
confusion O
. O

Patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
neurology O
service O
. O

She O
had O
a O
gradual O
imporvement O
of O
her O
confusion O
back O
towards O
baseline O
during O
the O
hospital O
stay O
. O

The O
major O
therapeutic O
change O
during O
the O
hospitalization O
was O
the O
starting O
of O
zyprexa O
to O
see O
if O
as O
part O
of O
its O
side-effect O
profile O
it O
would O
decrease O
the O
choreoathetotic O
movement O
symptoms O
. O

Infact O
, O
this O
medication O
was O
found O
to O
cause O
a O
significant O
improvement O
in O
her O
choreoathetotic O
perioral O
and O
arm O
movements O
. O

She O
still O
has O
significant O
myoclonic O
component O
in O
her O
arms O
especially O
with O
volition O
, O
but O
this O
med O
will O
certainly O
be O
continued O
. O

While O
essentially O
what O
we O
ARE O
hoping O
for O
in O
this O
use O
of O
the O
med O
is O
extra-pyramidal O
side O
effects O
, O
she O
should O
be O
monitored O
for O
any O
excessive O
or O
debilitating O
parkinsonian O
symptoms O
such O
as O
excessive O
rigidity O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O

In O

with O
the O
Neurology O
Service O
, O
who O
followed O
the O
patient O
with O
us O
, O
we O
ordered O
an O
EEG O
and O

An O

was O
performed O
, O
in O
which O
we O
measured O
the O

as O
unremarkable O
at O
14.5 O

. O

From O
an O
infectious O
disease O
perspective O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
afebrile O
and O
, O
despite O
a O
transient O
bump O
in O
her O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
over O
the O
weekend O
of O
08/10 B-DATE
through O
08/12 B-DATE
2002 O
, O
has O
had O
a O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
come O
back O
to O
normal O
range O
of O
12.0 O
. O

No O
obvious O
source O
of O
infection O
was O
found O
, O
with O
negative O
cultures O
from O
blood O
, O
urine O
, O
sputum O
, O
the O
peritoneal O
fluid O
, O
and O
cerebrospinal O
fluid O
. O

Excellent O
suggestions O
from O
Dr. O
Pa B-DOCTOR
of O
the O
Renal O
Service O
included O
repeating O
anticardiolipin O
and O
lupus O
anticoagulant O
, O
given O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
weakly O
positive O
lupus O
anticoagulant O
in O
the O
past O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
could O
be O
associated O
with O
severe O
and O
rapid O
cognitive O
decline O
that O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
patient O
. O

However O
, O
these O
antibodies O
were O
both O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
mental O
status O
gradually O
began O
to O
improve O
during O
the O
course O
ofthe O
weekend O
from O
08/10 B-DATE
through O
08/12 B-DATE
and O
was O
markedly O
improved O
on O
08/13 B-DATE
2002 O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
day O
of O
admission O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
remains O
not O
oriented O
to O
time O
or O
to O
place O
, O
although O
she O
is O
now O
able O
to O
answer O
questions O
and O
actually O
carry O
on O
simple O
conversations O
appropriately O
. O

The O
nature O
of O
her O
cognitive O
decline O
and O
change O
in O
mental O
status O
is O
still O
unclear O
, O
with O
most O
typical O
and O
less O
typical O
causes O
of O
reversible O
change O
in O
mental O
status O
having O
been O
ruled O
out O
and O
no O
obvious O
sources O
of O
infection O
from O
blood O
, O
CSF O
, O
sputum O
, O
urine O
, O
or O
peritoneal O
fluid O
. O

On O
the O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
, O
there O
was O
a O
question O
of O
an O
ovarian O
cystic O
mass O
that O
raised O
the O
possibility O
of O
ovarian O
cancer O
. O

CA-125 O
levels O
were O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

We O
entertained O
the O
possibility O
of O
doing O
a O
pelvic O
ultrasound O
to O
further O
characterize O
this O
lesion O
. O

We O
will O
discuss O
the O
case O
further O
with O
the O
Neurology O
Service O
, O
who O
will O
evaluate O
the O
case O
more O
carefully O
tomorrow O
with O
their O
attending O
. O

Pending O
no O
further O
suggestions O
on O
their O
part O
, O
we O
have O
completed O
the O
metabolic O
work O
up O
for O
reversible O
causes O
of O
dementia O
and O
will O
likely O
discharge O
the O
patient O
to O
return O
to O
the O
Termarimed B-HOSPITAL
pending O
no O

. O

She O
subsequently O
had O
done O
well O
, O
although O
she O
had O
had O
chronic O
obstructive O
lung O
disease O
. O

She O
had O
been O
converted O
to O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
in O
1977 O
, O
but O
in O
1988 O
, O
the O
mitral O
valve O
on O
an O
echocardiogram O
was O
O.K. O

Her O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
81% O
, O
with O
no O
mitral O
regurgitation O
seen O
, O
with O
a O
peak O
gradient O
of O
9 O
and O
a O
mean O
gradient O
of O
about O
3 O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
she O
developed O
chronic O
obstructive O
pulmonary O
disease O
and O
asthma O
, O
and O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Times B-DOCTOR
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
pulmonologist O
down O
where O
she O
lives O
. O

She O
had O
been O
in O

most O
of O
the O
time O
for O
the O
last O

. O

A O
TEE O
showed O
minimal O
mitral O

. O

Nevertheless O
, O
because O
of O

as O
well O
as O
rapid O
supraventricular O
tachycardia O
going O
around O
130 O
. O

This O
was O
on O
diltiazem O
and O
digoxin O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
she O
had O
two O
0.4 O
second O
pauses O
intermittently O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
the O
diltiazem O
was O
stopped O
, O
and O
she O
was O
further O
observed O
. O

We O
could O
not O
catheterize O
her O
right O
away O
because O
her O
prothrombin O
time O
was O
a O
little O
too O
high O
. O

Over O
the O
weekend O
of O
observation O
, O
she O
continued O
to O
be O
in O
supraventricular O
tachycardia O
, O
but O
also O
developed O
a O
4.4 O
second O
pause O
on O
digoxin O
alone O
, O
which O
was O
in O
low O
therapeutic O
range O
. O

She O
also O
had O
supraventricular O
tachycardia O
which O
was O
going O
up O
to O
160 O
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
temporary O
pacemaker O
that O
put O
in O
on O
5/4 B-DATE
, O
and O
diltiazem O
was O
restarted O
. O

A O
cardiac O
catheterization O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
5/5 B-DATE
, O
once O
her O
prothrombin O
time O
had O
fully O
normalized O
. O

It O
showed O
that O
she O
had O
a O
large O
big O
right O
dominant O
coronary O
artery O
, O
which O
was O
free O
of O
any O
significant O
disease O
. O

The O
graft O
to O
the O
marginal O
artery O
was O
open O
, O
with O
good O
runoff O
into O
a O
large O
vessel O
. O

The O
left O
anterior O
descending O
had O
perhaps O
a O
mid-40% O
lesion O
only O
, O
with O
good O
left O
ventricular O
contraction O
and O
no O
mitral O
regurgitation O
seen O
on O
left O
ventricular O
angiogram O
. O

There O
was O
a O
very O
modest O
to O
moderate O
mitral O
valve O
gradient O
. O

The O
mitral O
valve O
area O
was O
calculated O
at O
1.2 O
square O
centimeters O
, O
and O
then O
with O
modest O
exercise O
, O
the O
mitral O
valve O
area O
calculated O
to O
1.7 O
square O
centimeters O
. O

Thus O
, O
she O
had O
, O
at O
the O
most O
, O
modest O
mitral O
stenosis O
of O
no O
clinical O
significance O
. O

With O
this O
data O
in O
hand O
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
her O
previous O
congestive O
episodes O
was O
probably O
related O
to O
sustained O
periods O
of O
rapid O
heart O
action O
with O
minimal O
mitral O
stenosis O
. O

A O
permanent O
pacemaker O
was O
put O
in O
on O
5/6 B-DATE
92 O
. O

This O
was O
an O
Intermedex O
292-03 O
pacemaker O
, O
set O
in O
the O
VVI O
mode O
with O
an O
escape O
rate O
of O
65 O
. O

She O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
. O

On O
diltiazem O
, O
60 O
, O
q.i.d. O
, O
she O
continued O
to O
have O
supraventricular O
tachycardia O
, O
running O
at O
around O
130 O
, O
so O
we O
switched O
her O
over O
to O
verapamil O
, O
four O
times O
a O
day O
, O
along O
with O
digoxin O
, O
0.125 O
, O
alternating O
with O
0.25 O
, O
qD O
, O
which O
gave O
her O
a O
blood O
level O
of O
1.0 O
. O

On O
this O
program O
, O
she O
is O
now O
beginning O
to O
ambulate O
with O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
around O
79-80 O
, O
and O
is O
starting O
to O
feel O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

We O
will O
ambulate O
her O
over O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

We O
have O
stopped O
her O
Lasix O
, O
and O
we O
will O
be O
watching O
her O
daily O
weight O
, O
and O
that O
has O
been O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
excellent O
health O
until O
July B-DATE
of O
1991 O
when O
she O
first O
noted O
a O
left O
clavicular O
mass O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
the O
mass O
continued O
to O
increase O
in O
size O
. O

On O
12/23 B-DATE
, O
she O
was O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Stonge B-DOCTOR
at O
Bri B-HOSPITAL
Health I-HOSPITAL
where O
a O
3 O
x O
7 O
cm O
left O
mid O
clavicular O
mass O
was O
noted O
. O

A O
fine O
needle O
aspirate O
of O
this O
mass O
reportedly O
revealed O
giant O
cell O
tumor O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
told O
that O
this O
was O
a O
benign O
tumor O
and O
that O
it O
could O
simply O
be O
watched O
and O
definitively O
treated O
after O
the O
delivery O
of O
her O
baby O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
the O
mass O
progressively O
increased O
in O
size O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
developed O
significant O
discomfort O
in O
this O
region O
. O

On O
1/5 B-DATE
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
a O
local O
tumor O
debulking O
at O
Bri B-HOSPITAL
Health I-HOSPITAL
under O
local O
anesthesia O
. O

The O
pathology O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
revealed O
an O
aggressive O
adenocarcinoma O
( O
micropapillary O
type O
; O
mucin O
producing O
) O
. O

This O
prompted O
further O
staging O
work-up O
. O

The O
patient O
subsequently O
had O
a O
limited O
chest O
CT O
at O
Bri B-HOSPITAL
Health I-HOSPITAL

showed O
diffuse O
bilateral O
pulmonary O
metastases O
, O
metastases O
to O
the O
sternum O
, O
rib O
, O
multiple O
spinal O
levels O
; O
internal O
mammary O
lymphadenopathy O
. O

The O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
the O
patient O
and O
child O
were O
discussed O
and O
after O
the O
patient O
decided O
to O
have O
an O
elective O
abortion O
, O
an O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
was O
obtained O
which O
revealed O
diffuse O
metastatic O
lesions O
of O
the O
liverspine O
, O
ribs O
and O
most O
of O
the O
lymph O
nodes O
. O

There O
was O
no O
obvious O
GIor O
pancreatic O
tumor O
identified O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
very O
firm O
nodule O
at O
the O
vertex O
of O
her O
calvarium O
. O

A O
specimen O
was O
obtained O
by O
fine O
needle O
aspiration O
and O
the O
pathology O
of O
this O
was O
consistent O
with O
adenocarcinoma O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Nimaconwood B-HOSPITAL
Valley I-HOSPITAL

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
work-up O
of O
his O
cholestatic O
jaundice O
picture O
along O
with O
work-up O
for O
his O
pulmonary O
process O
and O
treatment O
of O
both O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
pulmonary O
function O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
one O
possibility O
was O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
a O
Bactrim O
failure O
for O
PCP O
although O
this O
was O
unusual O
. O

He O
was O
started O
on O
Pentamidine O
, O
especially O
in O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
liver O
function O
tests O
were O
due O
possibly O
to O
Bactrim O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
covered O
with O
Erythromycin O
and O
Gentamicin O
for O
coverage O
of O
community O
acquired O
pneumonias O
and O
gram O
negative O
rods O
. O

He O
was O
given O
supplemental O
oxygen O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
his O
liver O
abnormalities O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
viral O
hepatitis O
was O
in O
the O
differential O
as O
well O
as O
several O
opportunistic O
infections O
of O
the O
liver O
but O
also O
was O
felt O
that O
Bactrim O
could O
be O
a O
cause O
of O
these O
abnormalities O
. O

Titers O
for O
CMV O
and O
Epstein-Barr O
virus O
were O
sent O
and O
a O
titer O
for O
toxoplasma O
was O
sent O
. O

Stool O
was O
sent O
for O
ova O
and O
parasites O
. O

Gastrointestinal O
was O
consulted O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
pre-status O
and O
required O
less O
oxygen O
. O

However O
, O
on O
02/10 B-DATE
91 O
, O
his O
respiratory O
rate O
increased O
and O
his O
oxygen O
saturation O
decreased O
. O

Actually O
in O
reviewing O
the O
records O
at O
this O
point O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
Pentamidine O
was O
not O
started O
initially O
so O
on O
the O
antibiotics O
of O
Erythromycin O
and O
Gentamicin O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
worsened O
and O
his O
LDH O
climbed O
so O
he O
began O
Pentamidine O
on O
02/10 B-DATE
91 O
. O

On O
02/11 B-DATE
91 O
, O
the O
patient O
again O
appeared O
more O
comfortable O
this O
time O
with O
50% O
facemask O
but O
then O
required O
more O
oxygen O
, O
dropped O
his O
O2 O
saturations O
, O
and O
was O
intubated O
on O
02/11 B-DATE
91 O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
on O
12/12 B-DATE
90 O
on O
Gentamicin O
, O
Vancomycin O
, O
Pentamidine O
, O
and O
Prednisone O
. O

Also O
of O
note O
at O
that O
point O
, O
hepatitis O
C O
virus O
serologies O
had O
come O
back O
positive O
. O

However O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
his O
liver O
function O
test O
abnormalities O
appeared O
more O
consistent O
with O
a O
cholestatic O
picture O
with O
his O
direct O
bilirubin O
being O
12.1 O
and O
total O
being O
14.1 O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
showed O
no O
liver O
disease O
and O
no O
obstruction O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
liver O
function O
tests O
appeared O
to O
improve O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
penile O
ulcer O
was O
cultured O
and O
grew O
positive O
herpes O
simplex O
virus O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
Acyclovir O
. O

On O
02/13 B-DATE
91 O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
bronchoalveolar O
lavage O
performed O
which O
showed O
a O
toluidine O
blue O
with O
many O
pneumocysts O
noted O
. O

No O
other O
cultures O
grew O
out O
and O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
clinical O
status O
deteriorated O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
100% O
oxygen O
to O
maintain O
adequate O
oxygen O
saturations O
on O
the O
ventilator O
. O

He O
required O
elevated O
ventilatory O
pressures O
with O
PIPS O
often O
above O
60 O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
no O
evidence O
of O
baratroma O
was O
ever O
discerned O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
continued O
to O
decline O
and O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
maintain O
oxygen O
saturations O
above O
80% O
even O
using O
reverse O
I O
to O
E O
ventilation O
, O
paralysis O
, O
sedation O
, O
and O
other O
modes O
of O
ventilation O
. O

Patient O
underwent O
liver O
biopsy O
on O
02/16 B-DATE
91 O
and O
the O
results O
of O
this O
were O
pending O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

The O
patient O
actually O
developed O
decreasing O

with O
white O
count O
as O
low O
as O
1.75 O
, O
hematocrit O

, O
and O

02/15 B-DATE
91 O
. O

These O
were O
supported O
with O
blood O
products O
and O
Hematology O
was O
consulted O
. O

They O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
Bactrim O
and O
these O
actually O
were O
getting O
better O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

Bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
was O
not O
attempted O
. O

Discussions O
were O
begun O
with O
the O
family O
regarding O
limits O
of O
supportive O
care O
. O

Due O
to O
continued O
worsening O
pulmonary O
status O
and O
an O
overall O
grim O
prognosis O
, O
the O
family O
decided O
, O
in O
consultation O
with O
the O
Medical O
Team O
, O
to O
withdraw O

This O
was O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
Goman B-HOSPITAL
25 I-HOSPITAL
where O
she O
was O
hydrated O
for O
the O
presumed O
diagnosis O
of O
pre-renal O
azotemia O
. O

A O
urinalysis O
was O
notable O
for O
pyuria O
with O
50 O
to O
100 O
white O
cells O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
begun O
on O
Levofloxacin O
for O
presumed O
polymicrobial O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
. O

A O
head O
CT O
scan O
was O
performed O
which O
showed O
multiple O
old O
ischemic O
infarcts O
in O
the O
right O
frontal O
and O
cerebellar O
lobes O
. O

There O
was O
diffuse O
atrophy O
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
recent O
bleed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
rheumatology O
service O
who O
noted O
that O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
diagnosis O
was O
most O
consistent O
with O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
and O
possibly O
PMR O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Friednantflirt B-DOCTOR
of O
the O
Ph B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Of I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

At O
that O
time O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
undergone O
bilateral O
temporal O
artery O
biopsies O
, O
both O
of O
which O
were O
negative O
for O
temporal O
arteritis O
. O

The O
recommendation O
from O
the O
rheumatology O
service O
was O
to O
attempt O
to O
decrease O
her O
Prednisone O
to O
5 O
mg O
PO O
q.day O
with O
an O
eye O
on O
a O
change O
in O
the O
severity O
of O
her O
shoulder O
arthritis O
symptoms O
. O

On O
the O
third O
hospital O
day O
the O
patient O
developed O
a O
sudden O
change O
in O
her O
mental O
status O
while O
taking O
pills O
. O

She O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
arousable O
and O
responsive O
and O
minimally O
conversation O
. O

However O
, O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
move O
her O
right O
arm O
or O
leg O
. O

Her O
eyes O
were O
deviated O
to O
the O
left O
and O
she O
had O
a O
right O
facial O
droop O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
emergent O
CAT O
scan O
which O
revealed O
no O
acute O
bleeding O
and O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
cerebral O
vascular O
occlusion O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
Stroke O
Service O
, O
which O
recommended O
a O
lumbar O
puncture O
which O
was O
performed O
and O
did O
not O
reveal O
evidence O
of O
meningitis O
. O

A O
cardiac O
ultrasound O
was O
performed O
which O
revealed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
50 O
percent O
with O
wall O
motion O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
inferior O
septal O
and O
inferior O
walls O
involving O
the O
apex O
. O

There O
was O
trace O
mitral O
regurgitation O
. O

Multiple O
aortic O
valve O
leaflets O
were O
thickened O
without O
stenosis O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O
intraventricular O
thrombus O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
treated O
by O
increasing O
her O
aspirin O
from O
81 O
mg O
to O
325 O
mg O
. O

She O
was O
also O
continued O
to O
be O
hydrated O
. O

Her O
blood O
pressure O
medications O
were O
held O
to O
allow O
increased O
cerebral O
perfusion O
. O

After O
careful O
discussion O
with O
the O
neurology O
service O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
at O
too O
great O
a O
risk O
to O
be O
started O
and O
maintained O
on O
anticoagulant O
therapy O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
treated O
conservatively O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
subsequently O
evaluated O
by O
the O
speech O
pathology O
service O
, O
the O
physical O
therapy O
service O
and O
the O
occupational O
therapy O
service O
for O
evaluation O
for O
her O
recovery O
from O
her O
stroke O
. O

Her O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
continued O
to O
decrease O
with O
hydration O
and O
Zestril O
was O
re-initiated O
and O
, O
as O
her O
blood O
pressure O
allowed O
, O
her O
Isordil O
was O
re-initiated O
and O
then O
her O
Zestril O
was O
increased O
to O
10 O
mg O
PO O
q.day O
. O

Digoxin O
was O
discontinued O
because O
of O
her O
improved O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
. O

The O
patient O
did O
have O
a O
steady O
decrease O
in O
her O
hematocrit O
to O
a O
minimum O
of O
26.2 O
and O
received O
one O
unit O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
with O
restoration O
of O
her O
hematocrit O
over O
30 O
. O

Her O
ferritin O
was O
83 O
and O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
guaiac O
positive O
stools O
. O

It O
was O
elected O
to O
defer O
further O
evaluation O
of O
her O
anemia O
at O
this O
time O
. O

However O
, O
if O
she O
became O
more O
evidently O
guaiac O
positive O
it O
would O
be O
appropriate O
to O
evaluate O
the O
source O
of O
bleeding O
in O
her O
colon O
and O
potentially O
in O
her O
esophagus O
and O
stomach O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
switched O
from O
aspirin O
to O
Plavix O
75 O
mg O
PO O
q.day O
in O
view O
of O
her O
history O
of O
lower O
GI O
bleeding O
. O

Major O
consideration O
toward O
the O
end O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hospitalization O
was O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
take O
adequate O
PO O
intake O
to O
maintain O
her O
volume O
status O
. O

Initially O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
require O
gastroscopy O
. O

However O
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
granddaughter O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
able O
to O
increase O
her O
po O
intake O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
assistance O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
granddaughter O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
likely O
that O
her O
PO O
intake O
would O
improve O
when O
she O
returned O
home O
to O
the O
nursing O
home O
. O

I O
discussed O
this O
with O
the O
granddaughter O
and O
told O
her O
that O
if O
her O
PO O
intake O
was O
inadequate O
, O
that O
gastrostomy O
tube O
would O
be O
reasonable O
in O
the O
future O
and O
that O
we O
would O
be O
available O
to O
assist O
in O
this O
as O
it O
became O
necessary O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
GI O
service O
who O
thought O
that O
a O
PEG O
would O
be O
quite O
feasible O
and O
that O
they O
would O
be O
delighted O
to O
do O
this O
if O
it O
was O
necessary O
and O
the O
patient O
and O
family O
agreed O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
have O
decided O
to O
postpone O
this O
issue O
for O
now O
and O
to O
see O
how O
she O
does O
when O
she O
returns O
to O
the O
nursing O
home O
. O

The O
patient O
will O
be O
transferred O
tomorrow O
to O
Naplesvillechaelty B-HOSPITAL
. O

The O

She O
was O
watched O
very O
closely O
while O
on O
the O

She O
was O
on O
GI O

precautions O
at O
all O

She O
had O
a O

She O
was O
kept O
NPO O
until O
January B-DATE
26 I-DATE
when O
she O
began O
to O
feel O
hungry O
. O

At O
that O
time O
clear O

. O

All O
of O
her O

were O
guaiaced O
. O

She O
also O
began O
Nadolol O
40 O
mg O
QD O
to O
reduce O
her O
portal O
hypertension O
. O

The O
GI O
consult O
team O
continued O
to O
follow O
her O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
to O
contact O
her O
physician O
at O
Va B-HOSPITAL
Sit I-HOSPITAL
Namar I-HOSPITAL
Healthcare I-HOSPITAL
and O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

Therefore O
we O
decided O
to O
work O
up O
her O
cirrhosis O
. O

She O
was O
described O
as O
having O
_______ O
cirrhosis O
and O
we O
decided O
that O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
etiology O
. O

Her O
ferritin O
and O
iron O
studies O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
evidence O
of O
hemochromatosis O
and O
her O
hep O
serologies O
were O
all O
negative O
. O

She O
also O
had O
negative O
antimitochondrial O
antibody O
and O
she O
also O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
ceruloplasmin O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
were O
also O
sent O
an O
alpha-1-antitrypsin O
, O
which O
was O
negative O
. O

She O
did O
very O
well O
over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
further O
bleeding O
. O

Her O
hematocrit O
stayed O
stable O
at O
approximately O
32 O
. O

We O
also O
did O
an O
ultrasound O
guided O
paracentesis O
. O

The O
peritoneal O
fluid O
showed O
a O
glucose O
of O
244 O
, O
total O
protein O
0.8 O
and O
a O
albumin O
of O
0.5 O
, O
globulin O
0.3 O
, O
amylase O
16 O
, O
LDH O
of O
51 O
. O

The O
serum O
albumin O
gradient O
was O
1.8 O
consistent O
with O
portal O
hypertension O
. O

The O
cell O
count O
showed O
a O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
of O
160 O
with O
16% O
polys O
. O

She O
therefore O
_________ O
criteria O
for O
a O
spontaneous O
bacterial O
peritonitis O
. O

Her O
platelet O
count O
stayed O
persistently O
low O
and O
we O
decided O
that O
it O
might O
be O
due O
to O
Cimetidine O
. O

Therefore O
we O
switched O
her O
Cimetidine O
to O
Prilosec O
. O

By O
the O
2th B-DATE
the O
patient O
was O
feeling O
very O
well O
and O
desired O
to O
transfer O
or O
discharge O
to O

. O

She O
wanted O
to O
be O

She O
was O
quite O

Approximately O
five O
days O
into O
the O
hospital O
stay O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
significant O
right O
parotid O
swelling O
. O

Plain O

soft O
tissue O
swelling O
, O
neck O

computerized O

revealed O
a O
nonspecific O
enlarged O
right O
parotid O
gland O
with O
increased O
attenuation O
consistent O
with O
an O
inflammatory O
or O
neoplastic O
process O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
refused O
intravenous O
contrast O
so O
a O
contrast O
study O
was O
not O
available O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
ENT O
who O
felt O
that O
her O
enlargement O
was O
more O
likely O
secondary O
to O
an O
inflammatory O
process O
although O
they O
could O
not O
rule O
out O
malignancy O
. O

They O
recommended O
that O
a O
cytology O
sample O
be O
obtained O
and O
sent O
and O
that O
the O
patient O
be O
treated O
with O
a O
14 O

Cytology O

called O

but O
by O
the O
time O
the O
cytologist O
came O
to O
do O
a O
fine O

aspiration O
the O
mass O
had O
shrunken O
to O
the O
point O
where O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
aspirate O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
attempting O
a O
biopsy O
and O
beginning O
antibiotic O
treatment O
was O
not O
indicated O
at O
this O

the O

to O
have O
may O
be O
metastatic O
disease O
to O
her O
skin O
on O
the O
right O
paraumbilical O
area O
. O

Because O

her O
age O
and O
mental O
condition O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
had O
cerebral O
atrophy O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
for O

unless O
she O
has O
any O
further O
problem O
and O
no O
further O
chemotherapy O
or O
treatment O
will O
be O

. O

The O
possibility O
that O

need O
to O
receive O
radiation O
therapy O
to O
this O
area O
to O
prevent O
her O
from O
getting O
further O
obstruction O
was O
also O
brought O
up O
. O

Her O
family O
felt O
that O
at O
the O
present O
time O
, O
because O
her O
condition O
was O
no O
good O
, O
they O
would O
like O
to O
just O
take O
her O
home O
so O
that O
she O
could O
enjoy O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

Indeed O

at O
the O
time O
of O

she O
was O
conscious O
and O
she O
was O
cooperative O
and O
she O
was O
able O
to O
communicate O
very O
nicely O
with O
everyone O
including O
her O
family O
, O
except O
for O
the O
mental O
instability O
that O
she O
had O
because O
of O
her O
cerebral O
atrophy O
due O
to O
senility O
. O

dark O
brown O
bilious O
guaiac O
positive O
fluid O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
stabilized O
with O
fluid O
and O
improved O
quickly O
from O
this O
status O
over O
the O
weekend O
and O
Hct O
has O
been O
stable O
since O
that O
time O
. O

Other O
GI O
issues O
include O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hypopharyngeal O
cancer O
which O
will O
be O
discussed O
below O
. O

2) O
Oncology O
- O
The O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
prior O
to O
this O
admission O
with O
hypopharyngeal O
cancer O
for O
which O
he O
was O
going O
to O
undergo O
external O
radiation O
therapy O
for O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
multiple O
complications O
and O
lack O
of O
nutrition O
and O
inability O
of O
the O
patient O
to O
swallow O
without O
aspirating O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
should O
be O
delayed O
until O
he O
is O
under O
better O
nutritional O
status O
. O

3) O
Feeding O
and O
nutrition O
- O
The O
patient O
was O
unable O
to O
eat O
any O
food O
or O
drink O
by O
mouth O
given O
that O
he O
demonstrated O
frank O
aspiration O
each O
time O
he O
attempted O
this O
including O
with O
soft O
solids O
and O
puree O
foods O
. O

A O
swallowing O
study O
was O
performed O
which O
clearly O
demonstrated O
frank O
aspiration O
and O
poor O
swallowing O
mechanism O
by O
the O
patient O
. O

Several O
NG O
tubes O
were O
placed O
and O
the O
patient O
kept O
pulling O
the O
NG O
tubes O
out O
because O
his O
mental O
status O
was O
not O
completely O
cleared O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
sustained O
on O
IV O
fluids O
with O
D10 O
and O
multivitamins O
, O
thiamine O
, O
and O
folate O
. O

He O
was O
kept O
NPO O
given O
his O
history O
of O
aspiration O
and O
further O
attempts O
were O
made O
to O
fee O
the O
patient O
and O
finally O
as O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
mental O
status O
cleared O
he O
was O
responsive O
to O
having O
an O
NG O
feeding O
tube O
placed O
with O
Jevity O
feeds O
started O
. O

Other O
options O
were O
considered O
including O
a O
PEG O
placement O
as O
well O
as O
surgical O
placement O
of O
a O
gastrostomy O
tube O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
less O
aggressive O
measures O
with O
an O
NG O
tube O
would O
be O
prudent O
at O
this O
juncture O
given O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
the O
future O
. O

The O
family O
was O
involved O
in O
making O
decisions O
regarding O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
nutritional O
status O
and O
originally O
felt O
that O
IV O
fluids O
alone O
should O
be O
used O
, O
however O
, O
finally O
decided O
that O
some O
sort O
of O
feeding O
should O
be O
undertaken O
and O
the O
NG O
tube O
was O
the O
initial O
thought O
. O

It O
is O
felt O
that O
if O
the O
NG O
tube O
does O
not O
work O
out O
the O
patient O
may O
need O
to O
be O
reassessed O
for O
potential O
placement O
of O
a O
gastrostomy O
tube O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
felt O
by O
all O
parties O
involved O
that O
the O
aggressive O
end O
may O
also O
present O
significant O
risk O
to O
this O
patient O
given O
that O
an O
operative O
procedure O
may O
be O
dangerous O
and O
patient O
has O
shown O
significant O
desaturation O
and O
uncooperativeness O
with O
his O
first O
EGD O
on O
admission O
. O

4) O
Pulmonary O
- O
The O
patient O
had O
a O
clear O
chest O
x-ray O
other O
than O
a O
right O
lower O
lobe O
opacity O
consistent O
with O
scarring O
vs. O
fat O
pad O
which O
has O
been O
chronic O
on O
admission O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
saturating O
well O
throughout O
the O
initial O
part O
of O
the O
stay O
until O
he O
had O
the O
upper O
GI O
bleed O
on O
9/22 B-DATE
93 O
at O
which O
time O
he O
also O
had O
significant O
aspiration O
of O
vomitus O
and O
was O
considered O
to O
have O
a O
probable O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
but O
with O
vague O
findings O
on O
chest O
x-ray O
. O

The O
chest O
x-ray O
cleared O
rather O
rapidly O
and O
on O
the O
third O
day O
post O
aspiration O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
original O
admission O
x-ray O
. O

However O
, O
after O
aspiration O
given O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
white O
count O
bump O
from O
under O
10,000 O
to O
16,000 O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
he O
should O
be O
started O
on O
antibiotics O
and O
he O
was O
started O
on O
Ceftriaxone O
and O
clindamycin O
for O
a O
total O
10 O
day O
course O
for O
presumptive O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
afebrile O
throughout O
this O
period O
and O
tolerated O
antibiotics O
well O
and O
pneumonia O
appeared O
to O
resolve O
. O

No O
organism O
was O
ever O
cultured O
out O
of O
the O
sputum O
. O

5) O
GU O
- O
The O
patient O
was O
not O
entirely O
responsive O
to O
using O
urinal O
or O
the O
bathroom O
and O
at O
times O
was O
incontinent O
. O

It O
was O
thought O
that O
a O
Foley O
catheter O
would O
be O
most O
appropriate O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
tolerate O
this O
well O
. O

He O
had O
at O
one O
point O
the O
possibility O
of O
UTI O
but O
he O
was O
asymptomatic O
and O
on O
rechecking O
the O
urine O
there O
was O
no O
sign O
of O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
asymptomatic O
. O

6) O
Neurological O
- O
The O
patient O
originally O
was O
almost O
completely O
non-responsive O
at O
least O
to O
verbal O
command O
but O
as O
his O
hospital O
course O
progressed O
he O
became O
somewhat O
more O
alert O
and O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
his O
hospital O
course O
was O
much O
more O
alert O
and O
oriented O
usually O
only O
times O
two O
and O
was O
difficult O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
much O
more O
cooperative O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
his O
stay O
and O
much O
more O
appropriate O
, O
however O
, O
he O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
fully O
comprehend O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
had O
cancer O
and O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
swallow O
things O
by O
mouth O
. O

These O
issues O
were O
explained O
to O
him O
repeatedly O
, O
however O
, O
he O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
comprehend O
them O
from O
day O
to O
day O
. O

Psychiatry O
evaluated O
the O
patient O
and O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
not O
competent O
to O
decide O
his O
own O
affairs O
. O

7) O
Social O
issues O
- O
The O
wife O
had O
obtained O
health O
proxy O
prior O
to O
this O
admission O
and O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
since O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
competent O
to O
make O
decisions O
on O
his O
own O
the O
wife O
would O
make O
decisions O
regarding O
the O
health O
status O
and O
treatment O
of O
the O
patient O
. O

It O
was O

8) O
Dental O
- O
The O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
very O
few O
teeth O
and O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
none O
appeared O
viable O
and O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
since O
he O
would O
be O
undergoing O
XRT O
in O
the O
future O
that O
his O
teeth O
should O
be O
removed O
to O
avoid O
radiation O
necrosis O
in O
the O
future O
when O
he O
received O
his O
XRT O
. O

He O
underwent O
extraction O
of O
all O
his O
teeth O
on O
9/21 B-DATE
93 O
tolerating O
the O
procedure O
well O
initially O
but O
then O
developed O
the O

The O
patient O
had O
a O

. O

A O
faint O

it O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
is O
probably O
not O
any O

and O
not O
of O
concern O
, O
however O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

Mr. O
Elms B-PATIENT
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
and O
after O
multiple O
cultures O
were O
drawn O
, O
he O
was O
subsequently O
taken O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
8/21 B-DATE
96 O
for O
incision O
and O
drainage O
of O
a O
right O
thigh O
abscess O
. O

There O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
component O
of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
to O
this O
, O
and O
he O
was O
taken O
back O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
the O
next O
day O
for O
incision O
and O
drainage O
of O
a O
pelvic O
abscess O
and O
intraabdominal O
abscess O
. O

Cultures O
from O
his O
abdomen O
subsequently O
grew O
out O
methicillin O
resistant O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
and O
Pseudomonas O
. O

His O
clinical O
condition O
continued O
to O
worsen O
with O
evidence O
of O
ongoing O
sepsis O
and O
renal O
failure O
, O
which O
transiently O
improved O
on O
hemodialysis O
, O
but O
generally O
progressively O
worsened O
. O

On O
9/3 B-DATE
96 O
, O
he O
underwent O
a O
transverse O
colostomy O
to O
allow O
diversion O
from O
the O
nonhealing O
leg O
and O
pelvis O
wounds O
. O

A O
lengthy O
course O
ensued O
, O
during O
which O
time O
his O
renal O
function O
remained O
quite O
poor O
, O
and O
he O
had O
several O
intermittent O
septic O
episodes O
. O

His O
nutrition O
remained O
poor O
throughout O
this O
time O
in O
spite O
of O
numerous O
attempts O
at O
enteral O
alimentation O
. O

On O
11/26 B-DATE
96 O

had O
a O
hypotensive O
bradycardic O
arrest O
at O

end O
of O
a O
dialysis O
run O
. O

He O
was O
intubated O
at O
this O
time O
and O
could O
not O
be O
extubated O
thereafter O
. O

He O
became O
increasingly O
more O
unresponsive O
and O
remained O
quite O
septic O
and O
febrile O
, O
resistant O
to O
aggressive O
antibiotic O
treatment O
. O

His O
kidney O
function O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
, O
and O
after O
extensive O
discussions O
with O
his O
sister O
and O
son O
, O
it O
was O
deemed O
appropriate O
to O
begin O
withdrawing O
care O
. O

Given O
that O
there O
appeared O
to O
be O
little O
hope O
for O
meaningful O
recovery O
to O
a O
point O
acceptable O
to O
the O
patient O
, O
the O
family O
agreed O
that O
withdrawing O
aggressive O
medical O
support O
was O
reasonable O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
two O
days O
, O
Mr. O
Elms B-PATIENT
was O
kept O
comfortable O
and O
given O
intravenous O
fluids O
and O
tube O
feeds O
, O
but O
he O
remained O
extremely O
ill O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
until O
12/3 B-DATE
96 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
became O
bradycardic O
and O
asystolic O
. O

He O
had O
no O
spontaneous O
cardiac O
or O
neurologic O
activity O
at O
this O
time O
, O
and O
he O
was O
declared O
dead O
at O
12:15 O
A.M. O
on O
12/3 B-DATE
96 O
. O

The O
family O
was O
notified O
, O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
, O
placed O
on O
intravenous O
fluids O
. O

He O
was O
continued O
on O
his O
imipenem O
, O
intravenously O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
total O
parenteral O
nutrition O
. O

On O
4/17 B-DATE
95 O
, O
GI O
Interventional O
Radiology O
performed O
drainage O
of O
the O
peripancreatic O
fluid O
collection O
. O

Approximately O
one O
liter O
of O
brownish O
fluid O
was O
obtained O
and O
sent O
for O
culture O
. O

The O
drainage O
catheter O
was O
left O
in O
a O
pseudocyst O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Cardiology O
. O

A O
Persantine O
Thallium O
study O
demonstrated O
a O
large O
infarct O
, O
involving O
the O
posteroseptal O
, O
anteroseptal O
areas O
. O

Left O
ventricular O
aneurysm O
was O
also O
noted O
; O
however O
, O
no O
ischemia O
was O
seen O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
was O
done O
. O

The O
echocardiogram O
showed O
terrible O
left O
ventricular O
function O
, O
with O
left O
ventricular O
aneurysm O
. O

The O
right O
ventricle O
appeared O
to O
be O
acceptable O
. O

The O
percutaneous O
drainage O
catheter O
continued O
to O
have O
high O
output O
. O

The O
fluid O
was O
sent O
for O
amylase O
, O
which O
came O
back O
53,230 O
. O

On O
4/28 B-DATE
95 O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
new O
onset O
of O
abdominal O
pain O
. O

His O
white O
count O
had O
bumped O
from O
8.3 O
on O
admission O
to O
18.5 O
, O
on O
4/27 B-DATE
. O

A O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
of O
the O
abdomen O
was O
performed O
. O

Approximately O
100 O
cc.&apos;s O
of O
thick O
brownish O
material O
was O
aspirated O
through O
the O
indwelling O
catheter O
. O

The O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
showed O
the O
catheter O
tip O
in O
good O
position O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
deteriorating O
state O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
4/28 B-DATE
95 O
. O

An O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
splenic O
flexure O
had O
a O
purulent O
exudative O
process O
along O
the O
antimesenteric O
surface O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
splenic O
flexure O
and O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
descending O
colon O
were O
resected O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
a O
left O
colectomy O
with O
end O
transverse O
colostomy O
, O
and O
oversewing O
of O
the O
descending O
colon O
. O

Drainage O
of O
the O
pancreatic O
necrosis O
was O
also O
done O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
fairly O
well O
, O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

In O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
prolonged O
course O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
extubated O
on O
postoperative O
day O
#2 O
, O
but O
remained O
pressor-dependent O
. O

He O
remained O
on O
imipenem O
, O
and O
Vancomycin O
was O
also O
started O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
long O
and O
complicated O
postoperative O
course O
. O

He O
was O
eventually O
transferred O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
where O
he O
remained O
meta-stable O
. O

He O
had O
repeated O
episodes O
of O
hypotension O
to O
80-90 O
systolic/40-50 O
diastolic O
. O

These O
resolved O
without O
incident O
. O

He O
also O
had O
repeated O
temperature O
spikes O
. O

After O
repeated O
work O
ups O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
these O
were O
probably O
due O
to O
remaining O
infection O
in O
the O
peripancreatic O
area O
. O

His O
drainage O
tube O
from O
the O
peripancreatic O
area O
was O
gradually O
advanced O
, O
and O
eventually O
discontinued O
. O

Mr. O
Mass B-PATIENT
was O
placed O
on O
multiple O
courses O
of O
antibiotics O
. O

Most O
recently O
, O
he O
was O
on O
a O
28 O
day O
course O
of O
Vancomycin O
, O
ofloxacin O
, O
and O
Flagyl O
, O
for O
blood O
cultures O
that O
were O
positive O
for O
gram O
positive O
cocci O
and O
enteric O
and O
non-enteric O
gram O
negative O
rods O
. O

This O
28 O
day O
course O
was O
completed O
on O
07/15 B-DATE
95 O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
treated O
initially O
with O
amphotericin-B O
and O
then O
with O
fluconazole O
for O
a O
computerized O
tomography O
guided O
aspirate O
of O
a O
small O
fluid O
collection O
around O
his O
pancreas O
, O
which O
grew O
Candida O
albicans O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
had O
several O
episodes O
of O
fungal O
cystitis O
with O
Torulopsis O
glabrata O
, O
going O
from O
his O
urine O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
amphotericin-B O
bladder O
washes O
for O
this O
. O

Mr. O
Mass B-PATIENT
was O
initially O
anticoagulated O
for O
his O
left O
ventricular O
aneurysm O
. O

He O
remained O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiac O
fashion O
. O

He O
did O
have O
problems O
with O
po O
intake O
. O

He O
had O
repeated O
bouts O
of O
small-volume O
emesis O
that O
may O
have O
been O
secondary O
to O
reflux O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
anti-emetics O
, O
most O
recently O
Granisetron O
, O
with O
only O
mild O
success O
. O

He O
remained O
total O
parenteral O
nutrition-dependent O
throughout O
his O
hospital O
course O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
June B-DATE
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
Mr. O
Mass B-PATIENT
would O
require O
aggressive O
surgical O
intervention O
in O
order O
to O
eradicate O
his O
intra-abdominal O
bursts O
of O
intermittent O
sepsis O
; O
however O
, O
long O
discussions O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
was O
his O
health-care O
proxy O
, O
revealed O
that O
they O
felt O
that O
no O
further O
aggressive O
intervention O
be O
attempted O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
made O
a O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
do O
not O
intubate O
patient O
earlier O
in O
his O
hospital O

were O
held O
between O

the O
surgical O
team O
, O
and O
the O

primary O
doctor O
, O
Dr. O
Douet B-DOCTOR
at O

it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
after O
placement O
of O
a O
nasogastric O
tube O
and O
was O
brought O
emergently O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
after O
a O
CT O
scan O
done O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
revealed O
marked O
dilatation O
of O
the O
afferent O
loop O
and O
duodenum O
. O

There O
was O
significant O
dilatation O
from O
the O
duodenal O
stump O
to O
the O
proximal O
jejunum O
and O
an O
abrupt O
transition O
point O
prior O
to O
the O
likely O
anastomosis O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
perforation O
on O
the O
CT O
scan O
. O

The O
patient O
went O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
03/13 B-DATE
00 O
and O
after O
extensive O
lysis O
of O
adhesions O
, O
the O
Roux-en-Y O
anastomosis O
of O
jejunum O
to O
jejunum O
was O
examined O
and O
there O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
slightly O
proximal O
adhesion O
compressing O
the O
afferent O
limb O
. O

This O
was O
taken O
down O
and O
the O
Roux-en-Y O
anastomosis O
was O
re-sited O
proximally O
. O

There O
was O
no O
other O
obvious O
finding O
on O
the O
initial O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
and O
the O
peritoneal O
fluid O
that O
was O
encountered O
appeared O
just O
ascitic O
in O
nature O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
tachycardic O
and O
had O
low O
urine O
output O
which O
initially O
was O
responsive O
to O
intravenous O
boluses O
of O
Crystalloid O
. O

However O
by O
the O
mid O
morning O
of O
the O
14th B-DATE
of I-DATE
March I-DATE
, O
the O
patient O
had O
ceased O
making O
urine O
and O
had O
become O
profoundly O
tachycardic O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
invasively O
lined O
with O
a O
Swan O
Ganz O
catheter O
and O
arterial O
line O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
creatinine O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
esculated O
to O
2.1 O
and O
his O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
was O
close O
to O
4 O
on O
admission O
had O
plummeted O
to O
0.43 O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
broad O
spectrum O
antibiotics O
for O
the O
prospect O
of O
sepsis O
given O
his O
neutropenia O
and O
previous O
splenectomy O
and O
then O
an O
echocardiogram O
was O
performed O
to O
assess O
left O
ventricular O
function O
. O

The O
transesophageal O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
essentially O
normal O
left O
ventricular O
function O
but O
was O
a O
very O
limited O
exam O
. O

The O
Swan O
Ganz O
catheter O
numbers O
confirmed O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
suboptimal O
cardiac O
output O
and O
was O
developing O
a O
septic O
like O
picture O
. O

On O
03/14 B-DATE
00 O
the O
patient O
returned O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
for O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
after O
pressors O
and O
antibiotics O
did O
not O
reverse O
his O
septic O
course O
. O

Upon O
exploring O
the O
abdomen O
, O
the O
adhesions O
were O
fully O
lysed O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
abdomen O
and O
bile O
staining O
was O
noted O
in O
the O
retroperitoneum O
. O

However O
prior O
to O
this O
it O
was O
also O
noted O
that O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
scrotum O
was O
necrotic O
. O

An O
incision O
was O
made O
into O
the O
scrotum O
and O
bilious O
staining O
was O
encountered O
. O

Therefore O
the O
patient O
underwent O
a O
scrotal O
debridement O
and O
bilateral O
orchiectomy O
as O
well O
as O
debridement O
of O
the O
right O
spermatic O
cord O
, O
debridement O
of O
the O
peritoneum O
over O
the O
bladder O
which O
additionally O
had O
bilious O
staining O
. O

In O
the O
abdomen O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
retroperitoneum O
was O
fully O
debrided O
and O
the O
source O
of O
the O
bilious O
staining O
was O
traced O
back O
to O
the O
junction O
of O
the O
second O
and O
third O
portion O
of O
the O
duodenum O
which O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
2.5x2.5 O
centimeter O
perforation O
which O
all O
appeared O
walled-off O
. O

The O
anastomosis O
appeared O
intact O
on O
examination O
. O

Upon O
return O
to O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
following O
this O
procedure O
, O
the O
patient O
still O
had O
a O
septic-like O
picture O
and O
was O
maintained O
on O
Neo-Synephrine O
. O

He O
was O
hydrated O
vigorously O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
afore O
mentioned O
duodenal O
perforation O
, O
the O
patient O
also O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a O
pancreatitis O
by O
enzymes O
. O

This O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
related O
to O
the O
back O
pressure O
in O
the O
afferent O
limb O
and O
this O
resolve O
over O
the O
course O
of O
his O
immediate O
postoperative O
days O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
urine O
output O
was O
marginal O
and O
the O
sepsis O
appeared O
not O
to O
be O
well O
controlled O
. O

therefore O
the O
patient O
went O
back O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
03/15 B-DATE
00 O
for O
another O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
. O

Further O
debridement O
was O
undertaken O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
washed O
out O
and O
an O
ileocecectomy O
for O
necrotic O
appearing O
bowel O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
went O
back O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
however O
his O
septic O
course O
was O
not O
reversed O
. O

On O
03/16 B-DATE
00 O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
completion O
colectomy O
and O
partial O
proctatectomy O
in O
the O
bed O
in O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
as O
a O
last O
ditch O
attempt O
to O
gain O
the O
upper O
hand O
on O
the O
septic O
physiology O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
did O
not O
reverse O
his O
septic O
course O
and O
despite O
maximal O
pressor O
management O
and O
fluid O
resuscitation O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
hypotensive O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
was O
confronted O
with O
the O
bleak O
nature O
of O
his O
prognosis O
and O
elected O
to O
withdraw O
support O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
03/16 B-DATE
00 O

. O

She O
has O
not O
used O
any O

no O
relief O
from O
antacids O
or O
H2 O

which O
showed O
fatty O
infiltration O
of O
her O
liver O
diffusely O
with O
a O
1 O
cm O
cyst O
in O
the O
right O
lobe O
of O
the O
liver O
. O

She O

a O
normal O
pancreas O
at O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
hyperdense O
kidneys O
. O

Her O
alkaline O

has O
had O
progressive O
failure O
to O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

By O
problems O
- O

1) O
INFECTIOUS O
DISEASE O
/ O
CELLULITIS O
: O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
clinical O
situation O
was O
most O
consistent O
with O
a O
Pseudomonas O
cellulitis O
and O
subsequent O
sepsis O
. O

Blood O
cultures O
drawn O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
grew O
out O
Pseudomonas O
that O
was O
sensitive O
to O
Imipenem O
and O
Tobramycin O
. O

There O
were O
cultures O
obtained O
seeping O
from O
the O
wound O
at O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
and O
those O
also O
grew O
out O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
. O

The O
organism O
grown O
at O
this O
institution O
was O
sensitive O
to O
Imipenem O
, O
Ceftazidime O
, O
Amikacin O
, O
gentamicin O
, O
Ciprofloxacin O
, O
Tobramycin O
but O
was O
resistant O
to O
Cefotetan O
, O
Ceftriaxone O
, O
Mezlocillin O
, O
Bactrim O
, O
Ampicillin O
, O
chloramphenicol O
, O
and O
sulbactam O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
initially O
with O
Ceftazidime O
and O
gentamicin O
but O
there O
was O
a O
question O
about O
the O
organism O
&apos;s O
susceptibility O
from O
lab O
studies O
done O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
. O

He O
was O
subsequently O
switched O
to O
Imipenem O
and O
Tobramycin O
and O
was O
maintained O
on O
those O
medications O
throughout O
the O
hospital O
course O
. O

The O
Tobramycin O
and O
Imipenem O
were O
started O
on O
11/25 B-DATE
94 O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
received O
a O
five O
day O
course O
of O
intravenous O
IgG O
to O
improve O
infection O
control O
. O

Vancomycin O
was O
also O
added O
to O
his O
regimen O
on O
11/28 B-DATE
94 O
and O
this O
was O
primarily O
to O
provide O
improved O
MRSA O
coverage O
as O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
erythema O
along O
the O
lateral O
right O
lower O
extremity O
. O

He O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
Surgery O
Department O
and O
it O
is O
there O
feeling O
that O
there O
is O
no O
indication O
for O
surgical O
intervention O
/ O
amputation O
at O
this O
time O
. O

He O
is O
being O
maintained O
with O
twice O
daily O
Xeroform O
with O
Betadine O
changes O
. O

These O
dressing O
changes O
are O
applied O
by O
applying O
the O
Xeroform O
on O
Betadine O
initially O
and O
then O
changing O
it O
with O
sterile O
dry O
bandages O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
extreme O
pain O
with O
these O
dressing O
changes O
and O
requires O
parenteral O
morphine O
sulfate O
for O
pain O
control O
during O
dressing O
changes O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
complete O
a O
full O
course O
of O
Imipenem O
and O
Tobramycin O
for O
his O
Pseudomonas O
cellulitis O
. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
erythema O
tracking O
up O
his O
leg O
and O
up O
to O
his O
lateral O
thigh O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
this O
erythema O
is O
not O
know O
at O
this O
time O
but O
has O
not O
shown O
extensive O
progression O
. O

2) O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
treated O
with O
Dopamine O
which O
was O
subsequently O
weaned O
off O
after O
his O
sepsis O
improved O
. O

He O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
in O
rapid O
AF O
on O
several O
episodes O
receiving O
5 O
mg O
IV O
Lopressor O
each O
time O
with O
improvement O
. O

He O
has O
been O
in O
and O
out O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
performed O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
while O
he O
was O
septic O
showed O
decreased O
global O
EF O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
being O
maintained O
on O
Digoxin O
for O
his O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

He O
has O
had O
no O
significant O
episode O
of O
tachycardia O
or O
blood O
pressure O
alteration O
during O
the O
final O
days O
of O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
continue O
the O
Digoxin O
and O
to O
recheck O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
assess O
his O
ejection O
fraction O
when O
he O
is O
clinically O
better O
. O

3) O
ONCOLOGY O
: O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
plasmacytoma O
affecting O
the O
spine O
. O

He O
has O
been O
receiving O
radiation O
therapy O
to O
that O
area O
during O
the O
hospital O
stay O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
complete O
a O
full O
course O
of O
XRT O
to O
the O
spinal O
region O
for O
the O
plasmacytoma O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
lesion O
compressing O
his O
thoracic O
spine O
was O
never O
biopsied O
, O
however O
, O
the O
MRI O
appearance O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
infectious O
and O
is O
most O
consistent O
with O
plasmacytoma O
for O
which O
he O
is O
receiving O
the O
radiation O
therapy O
. O

4) O
NEUROLOGIC O
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
he O
has O
a O
cord O
compression O
and O
is O
on O
steroids O
. O

He O
was O
initially O
treated O
with O
IV O
Decadron O
10 O
mg O
up O
front O
and O
then O
6 O
mg O
q6h. O

His O
neurological O
exam O
remained O
stable O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
increasing O
lower O
extremity O
edema O
. O

His O
Decadron O
dose O
was O
titrated O
down O
to O
5 O
mg O
IV O
q6h O
on O
12/3 B-DATE
94 O
. O

His O
Decadron O
dose O
will O
be O
slowly O
titrated O
down O
over O
time O
following O
his O
neurological O
exam O
closely O
. O

5) O
BLOOD O
SUGARS O
: O

The O
patient O
has O
steroid O
induced O
diabetes O
mellitus O
. O

He O
has O
been O
on O
increasing O
doses O
of O
insulin O
receiving O
NPH O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
night O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
CZI O
sliding O
scale O
on O
a O
q6h O
basis O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
continue O
the O
supplemental O
insulin O
while O
he O
is O
on O
steroids O
and O
while O
his O
sugars O
remain O
high O
. O

6) O
RESPIRATORY O
: O

He O
initially O
required O
a O
face O
mask O
to O
keep O
his O
saturation O
above O
90% O
. O

However O
, O
with O
increasing O
diuresis O
and O
improving O
septic O
pictures O
his O
O2 O
saturations O
have O
improved O
and O
he O
is O
now O
on O
nasal O
cannula O
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
nasal O
cannula O
to O
keep O
his O
sat O
above O
93% O
. O

He O
can O
be O
given O
intravenous O
Lasix O
as O
needed O
for O
any O
evidence O
of O
respiratory O
compromise O
or O
increasing O
pulmonary O
edema O
. O

7) O
NUTRITION O
: O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
poor O
nutritional O
status O
with O
hypoalbuminemia O
. O

He O
has O
been O
maintained O
on O
tube O
feeds O
and O
that O
should O
be O
continued O
. O

He O
should O
also O
be O
encouraged O
to O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
orally O
in O
addition O
to O
this O
tube O
feeds O
and O
aspiration O
precaution O
should O
be O
maintained O
. O

8) O
ELEVATED O
PT O
and O
PTT O
: O

Both O
of O
these O
responded O
to O
three O
day O
course O
of O
vitamin O
K O
10 O
mg O
each O
day O
. O

His O
PT O
and O
PTT O
are O
now O
normal O
, O
however O
, O
he O
continues O
to O
run O
a O
low O
platelet O
count O
. O

This O
has O
been O
evident O
since O
the O
time O
of O
his O
bone O
marrow O
transplant O
. O

We O
have O
been O
transfusing O
him O
with O
platelets O
to O
keep O
his O
counts O
above O
20,000 O
to O
reduce O
his O
bleeding O
risk O
. O

He O
also O
received O
several O
blood O
transfusions O
while O
here O
to O
maintain O
his O
Hct O
around O
30 O
. O

Thrombocytopenic O
inducing O
drugs O
should O
be O
avoided O
if O
possible O
on O
this O
patient O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
and O
started O
on O
Ampingent O
intravenously O
. O

There O
was O
a O
question O
of O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
so O
he O
was O
switched O
from O
Ampicillin O
pen-g O
to O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
. O

He O
was O
continued O
on O
his O
Parkinson O
&apos;s O
medications O
. O

A O
head O
CT O
was O
scheduled O
to O
rule O
out O
interval O
increase O
in O
subdurals O
. O

Head O
CT O
results O
show O
full O
bilateral O
acute O
hemorrhage O
in O
his O
subdural O
hematomas O
, O
now O
with O
slight O
midline O
shift O
. O

Dr. O
Factor B-DOCTOR
agreed O
he O
would O
review O
the O
CTs O
and O
follow O
the O
patient O
while O
in O
house O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
by O
urology O
, O
who O
suggested O
to O
leave O
the O
catheter O
in O
for O
now O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
doubt O
ms O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
by O
neuro O
, O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
subdural O
hemorrhages O
should O
be O
followed O
and O
treated O
conservatively O
as O
well O
as O
precautions O
for O
fall O
and O
no O
further O
intervention O
was O
warranted O
given O
risk O
of O
re-bleed O
which O
is O
quite O
high O
with O
his O
atrophic O
changes O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
mental O
status O
improved O
greatly O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
, O
doing O
much O
better O
, O
was O
much O
more O
awake O

was O
to O
possibly O
send O
him O

on O
po O
antibiotics O
and O
full O

Bedside O
swallow O

some O
aspiration O
. O

He O
did O
have O
some O
recurrent O
fevers O
and O
his O
intravenous O
antibiotic O
were O
continued O
. O

Thus O
, O
he O
was O
considered O
ready O
for O
discharge O
. O

He O
again O
became O
much O
more O
somnolent O
, O
there O
was O
a O
question O
whether O
he O
had O
re-aspirated O
. O

He O
again O
was O
becoming O
increasing O
febrile O
and O
somnolent O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
awaiting O
a O
chest O
x-ray O
and O
further O
evaluation O
. O

He O
was O
switched O
over O
the O
Clinda O
and O
Gentamicin O
for O
his O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
and O
again O
his O
mental O
status O
improved O
. O

On O

. O

A O
portable O

in O
a O
marked O
incomplete O
closure O
of O
the O

was O
treated O
conservatively O
with O
intubation O
, O
control O
of O
heart O
rate O
and O
on O
Dobutamine O
for O
pressure O
support O
. O

He O
was O
diuresed O
with O
Lasix O
and O
Diuril O
and O
was O
oxygenating O
fairly O
well O
while O
intubated O
. O

He O
surprisingly O
made O
it O
through O
the O
next O
24 O
hours O
. O

He O
was O
dynamically O
stable O
on O
his O
Dobutamine O
with O
improved O
oxygenation O

The O
patient O
continued O
fairly O
stable O
while O
intubated O

He O
had O
diuresed O
very O
well O

His O
neurostatus O
was O
indeterminate O
given O
his O
sedation O
on O
the O
ventilatory O
. O

Discussions O
with O
the O
family O
were O
ongoing O
regarding O
do O
not O
resuscitate O

long O
term O
plan O
given O
his O
comorbidities O
. O

They O
were O
waiting O
appropriately O
for O
some O
information O
from O
the O
repeat O
echo O
after O
his O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

An O
echo O
showed O
that O
there O
was O
not O
much O
improvement O
in O
cardiac O
function O
, O
both O
right O
or O
left O
ventriculus O
. O

They O
did O
at O
that O
time O
decide O
to O
make O
him O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
, O
but O
were O
interested O
in O
continuing O
supportive O
care O
to O
see O
how O
much O
he O
would O
bounce O

The O
repeat O

showed O
no O
improvement O
in O
left O
ventricle O
or O
right O
ventricle O
function O
with O
marked O
akinesis O
of O
many O
walls O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
meaningful O
recovery O
was O
much O
less O
likely O
. O

Discussions O
were O
had O
with O
the O
family O
regarding O
withdrawal O
of O
ventilator O
support O
, O
which O
they O
very O
appropriately O
decided O
on O
given O
the O
low O
possibility O
of O
any O
meaningful O
recovery O
. O

He O
was O
extubated O
successfully O
and O
was O
breathing O
comfortably O
on O
his O

The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
back O

in O
stable O
, O
but O
very O
guarded O
condition O
. O

No O
further O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O

patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Service O
under O
the O
care O
of O
Dr. O
Lenni B-DOCTOR
Pain I-DOCTOR
. O

Her O
abdominal O
exam O
revealed O
a O
diffusely O
tender O
abdomen O
which O
was O
greater O
in O
the O
lower O
quadrant O
without O
guarding O
, O
but O
with O
early O
peritoneal O
signs O
. O

A O
KUB O
performed O
on O
the O
night O
of O
admission O
showed O
no O
free O
air O
and O
no O
small O
bowel O
obstruction O
or O
ileus O
. O

An O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
with O
oral O
contrast O
did O
not O
show O
any O
evidence O
for O
fluid O
collection O
or O
abscess O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
diffuse O
thickening O
of O
the O
small O
bowel O
up O
to O
the O
terminal O
ileum O
, O
as O
well O
as O
some O
thickening O
of O
the O
rectum O
. O

This O
was O
not O
in O
a O
clear O
vascular O
distribution O
and O
there O
was O
no O
air O
evident O
in O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
small O
or O
large O
bowel O
. O

These O
findings O
were O
felt O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
radiation O
enteritis O
. O

She O
was O
admitted O
and O
made O
NPO O
. O

On O
admission O
, O
her O
white O
count O
was O
15,000 O
with O
an O
absolute O
neutrophil O
count O
of O
1,000 O
. O

She O
was O
initially O
afebrile O
and O
hemodynamically O
stable O
. O

Her O
ANC O
dropped O
to O
about O
200 O
over O
the O
next O
48 O
hours O
and O
she O
developed O
guaiac O
positive O
diarrhea O
. O

She O
was O
begun O
on O
IV O
antibiotics O
on O
admission O
of O
mezlocillin O
, O
gentamicin O
and O
metronidazole O
. O

She O
was O
also O
placed O
on O
neutropenic O
precautions O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
spike O
fevers O
and O
had O
episodes O
of O
peritoneal O
signs O
. O

However O
, O
repeated O
abdominal O
x-rays O
and O
CT O
scans O
continued O
to O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
obstruction O
or O
perforation O
. O

However O
, O
she O
did O
show O
persistent O
inflammation O
of O
her O
small O
bowel O
consistent O
with O
radiation O
enteritis O
. O

By O
7/15 B-DATE
96 O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
neutropenic O
but O
continued O
to O
spike O
low O
grade O
fevers O
. O

By O
7/18 B-DATE
96 O
she O
had O
become O
afebrile O
and O
antibiotics O
were O
discontinued O
. O

She O
was O
continued O
on O
bowel O
rest O
and O
four O
days O
prior O
to O
discharge O
she O
became O
entirely O
pain O
free O
in O
her O
abdomen O
and O
was O
started O
on O
TPN O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
a O
PICC O
line O
was O
placed O
for O
facilitating O
the O
administration O
of O
TPN O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
shortly O
after O
starting O
on O
her O
TPN O
her O
phosphate O
level O
dropped O
to O
1.8 O
and O
TPN O
was O
temporarily O
held O
due O
to O
concerns O
she O
may O
be O
suffering O
from O
receding O
syndrome O
. O

She O
was O
supplemented O
with O
Neutra-Phos O
and O
her O
TPN O
was O
restarted O
18 O
hours O
later O
. O

DISCHARGE O
PLAN O
: O

We O
recommend O
that O
she O
continue O
to O
rest O
her O
bowel O
for O
another O
seven O
days O
. O

During O
this O
time O
she O
will O
continue O
to O
receive O
TPN O
. O

After O
that O
period O
of O
time O
she O
should O
slowly O
start O
p.o. O
intake O
again O
starting O
with O
clear O
liquids O
and O
in O
particular O
avoiding O
fats O
and O
lactose O
. O

Her O
small O
bowel O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
intolerant O
to O
lactose O
for O
the O
near O
future O
. O

her O
multiple O

and O
ileostomy O
creation O
. O

The O
subsequent O
pathology O
report O
confirmed O
the O
initial O
impression O
that O
this O
was O
indeed O
diverticulitis O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
diverticulosis O
and O
acute O
and O
chronic O
inflammation O
with O
abscess O
formation O
in O
the O
sigmoid O
colon O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
improve O
postoperatively O
and O
had O
essentially O
an O
unremarkable O
course O
with O
the O
exception O
that O
his O
creatinine O
became O
elevated O
. O

A O
renal O
biopsy O
was O
then O
performed O
which O
failed O
to O
show O
signs O
of O
rejection O
. O

It O
was O
therefore O
felt O
that O
his O
elevation O
in O
creatinine O
was O
multifactorial O
related O
to O
the O
events O
surrounding O
surgery O
and O
the O
surgery O
itself O
. O

With O
just O
observation O
alone O
, O
his O
creatinine O
returned O
to O
a O
level O
of O
2.0 O
by O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
dictation O
, O
the O
patient O
is O
doing O
quite O
well O
, O
eating O
, O
ambulating O
, O
and O
taking O
his O
medications O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
discharged O
home O
in O
stable O
condition O
and O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
the O
clinic O
. O

It O
is O
anticipated O
that O
in O
three O
to O
four O
months O
, O
we O
will O
consider O
taking O
him O
back O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
to O
perform O
an O
ileostomy O
take-down O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
develop O
atrial O
fibrillation O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
related O
to O
electrolyte O
disturbances O
as O
well O
as O
perioperative O
stress O
. O

He O
ruled O
out O
for O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
a O
dilated O
left O
atrium O
at O
5 O
centimeters O
and O
left O
ventricular O
concentric O
hypertrophy O
without O
any O
evidence O
of O
wall O
motion O
abnormalities O
. O

A O
Holter O
monitor O
showed O
only O
atrial O
premature O
contractions O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
and O
evaluated O
by O
Cardiology O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
was O
well O
controlled O
on O
digoxin O
, O
Propanolol O
, O
and O
verapamil O
. O

Again O
, O
he O
does O
have O
a O
history O
of O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
tachycardia O
for O
which O
he O
came O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
verapamil O
treatment O
. O

He O
did O
have O
some O
postoperative O
hypertension O
which O
was O

with O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
25 O
year O
old O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
a O
gunshot O
wound O
many O
years O
ago O
and O
has O
had O
multiple O
surgical O
procedures O
since O
then O
. O

Most O
recently O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
an O
outside O
hospital O
with O
a O
drug O
overdose O
in O
adult O
respiratory O
distress O
syndrome O
and O
ultimately O
found O
to O
have O
Candidal O
pericarditis O
which O
eventually O
led O
to O
constrictive O
pericarditis O
. O

He O
had O
a O
pericardial O
window O
. O

He O
had O
a O
barium O
swallow O
and O
endoscopy O
and O
was O
said O
not O
to O
have O
gastric O
or O
pericardial O
ulcer O
. O

He O
had O
previous O
substernal O
gastric O
bypass O
because O
of O
an O
interruption O
of O
his O
esophagus O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
gunshot O
wound O
. O

He O
had O
been O
noted O
to O
have O
an O
ulcer O
and O
ultimately O
when O
he O
stabilized O
it O
was O
our O
feeling O
that O
he O
most O
likely O
had O
a O
gastric O
pericardial O
ulcer O
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
here O
for O
further O
management O
. O

We O
discussed O
the O
risks O
with O
his O
family O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
high O
risk O
in O
very O
poor O
condition O
and O
a O
cachectic O
malnourished O
edematous O
individuals O
who O
have O
very O
high O
venous O
pressures O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
. O

The O
family O
understood O
that O
this O
was O
a O
life O
saving O
procedure O
and O
only O
carried O
with O
it O
approximately O
50% O
chance O
of O
success O

Dr. O
Asha B-DOCTOR
Vengloan I-DOCTOR
of O
General O
Surgery O
consulted O
on O
the O
patient O
and O
concluded O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
require O
any O
surgical O
treatment O
of O
this O
problem O
at O
the O
current O
time O
and O
the O
best O
treatment O
for O
this O
situation O
would O
be O
to O
increase O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
nutrition O
. O

The O
patient O
takes O
poorly O
his O
po. O
diet O
. O

However O
he O
is O
able O

tolerate O
po&apos;s O
. O

He O
just O
claims O
to O
have O
no O
appetite O
and O
has O
very O
poor O

It O
has O
been O
noted O
to O
be O

. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
Foley O
catheter O
in O
and O
when O
the O
penile O
skin O
is O
very O
well O
healed O
his O
Foley O
catheter O
may O
be O
removed O
. O

Until O
this O
time O
he O
should O
be O
kept O

changes O
. O

5. O
Skin O
: O

The O

decubiti O
over O
his O
body O
, O
in O
particular O
his O

. O

Plastic O
Surgery O
was O
consulted O
Dr. O
Ca B-DOCTOR
Shuff I-DOCTOR
who O
saw O
the O
patient O
and O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
is O
not O
a O
surgical O
candidate O
at O
this O
point O
. O

These O
wounds O
should O
be O
treated O
with O
three O
times O
daily O
wet O
to O
dry O

. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

One O
of O
several O
PUOMC B-HOSPITAL
admissions O
for O
this O
88-year-old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
breast O
cancer O
initially O
diagnosed O
in O
1997 O
and O
treated O
with O
surgery O
, O
radiation O
, O
and O
hormonal O
treatment O
. O

She O
had O
actually O
completed O
her O
five O
years O
of O
Tomaxifin O
, O
but O
was O
continuing O
to O
be O
plagued O
by O
menopausal O
symptoms O
and O
finally O
in O
the O
summery O
of O
2004 O
understanding O
the O
obvious O
potential O
risks O
, O
she O
began O
an O
estrogen O
patch O
. O

Not O
long O
afterwards O
she O
began O
to O
develop O
some O
bone O
pains O
which O
progressed O
over O
the O
late O
summer O
and O
fall O
requiring O
escalation O
of O
opiates O
and O
restaging O
confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
metastases O
throughout O
her O
spine O
and O
in O
the O
base O
of O
her O
skull O
, O
ribs O
, O
arms O
, O
etc O
... O
but O
no O
visceral O
involvement O
. O

She O
ultimately O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
because O
of O
delirium O
and O
difficulty O
controlling O
the O
pain O
. O

She O
had O
no O
fevers O
, O
chills O
, O
headaches O
, O
or O
neck O
stiffness O
. O

There O
had O
been O
no O
focal O
neurologic O
changes O
. O

Up O
until O
this O
admission O
she O
had O
been O
relatively O
independent O
and O
was O
very O
dismayed O
to O
discover O
the O
extensive O
relapse O
of O

A O
CA O

was O
significantly O
elevated O
at O

( O

) O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
hydrated O
gently O
, O
given O
another O
dose O
of O
Zomaten O
to O
help O
with O
her O
calcium O
and O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
remained O
relatively O
lethargic O
while O
we O
held O
some O
of O
her O
long O
acting O
opiates O
. O

She O
gradually O
began O
to O
improve O
and O
was O
able O
to O
tell O
if O
the O
worst O
pain O
was O
in O
the O
right O
clavicle O
. O

This O
was O
assessed O
promptly O
by O
an O
x-ray O
that O
confirmed O
pathologic O
fracture O
of O
that O
site O
. O

She O
also O
went O
on O
to O
have O
cervical O
, O
thoracic O
, O
and O
lumbosacral O
MRIs O
to O
confirm O
the O
wide O
spread O
bony O
metastases O
in O
the O
vertebral O
bodies O
and O
old O
degenerative O
changes O
perhaps O
with O
some O
indentation O
of O
the O
thecal O
sac O
but O
with O
no O
radiologic O
evidence O
for O
cord O
compression O
. O

She O
had O
had O
some O
urinary O
hesitancy O
and O
difficulty O
moving O
her O
legs O
in O
the O
first O
few O
days O
that O
had O
lead O
to O
the O
concern O
to O
_________ O
quinine O
syndrome O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
opiates O
were O
tapered O
down O
she O
was O
able O
to O
void O
spontaneously O
and O
soon O
began O
to O
ambulate O
with O
the O
help O
of O
Physical O
Therapy O
. O

A O
single O
fraction O
to O
the O
collar O
bone O
seemed O
to O
help O
with O
pain O
. O

Her O
bowels O
required O
fairly O
heavy O
duty O
osmotic O
laxatives O
to O
keep O
them O
open O
. O

The O
sudden O
plunge O
in O
such O
a O
dependent O
state O
left O
her O
quite O
depressed O
and O
ultimately O
a O
small O
dose O
of O
Dexedrine O
was O
started O
partly O
to O
overcome O
the O
sedation O
of O
the O
opiates O
and O
perhaps O
improve O
her O
mood O
since O
more O
traditional O
antidepressants O
would O
take O
four O
to O
six O
weeks O
. O

PLAN O
: O

Escalate O
the O
doses O
of O
the O
Dexedrine O
perhaps O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
of O
10 O
mg O
at O
8 O
o&apos;clock O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
another O
10 O
mg O
around O
noon O
and O
see O
if O
she O
can O
get O
reasonable O
sleep O
at O
night O
on O
this O
schedule O
, O
adding O
on O
Remeron O
at O
night O
time O
for O
sleep O
as O
an O
antidepressant O
would O
be O
a O
possibility O
or O
to O
go O
right O
to O
a O
conventional O
SSRI O
overlap O
until O
it O
seems O
to O
show O
more O
affect O
. O

She O
lives O
with O
her O
elderly O
husband O
and O
he O
was O
appropriately O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
caring O
for O
her O
single-handedly O
, O
hence O
the O
transfer O
to O
a O
skilled O
nursing O
facility O
for O
a O
week O
or O
two O
of O
rehab O
. O

The O
patient O
and O
husband O
clearly O
expressed O
during O
this O
visit O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
or O
intubation O
and O
ventilator O
support O
in O
the O
event O
of O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest O
. O

She O
was O
begun O
on O
Letrazole O
as O
an O
____________ O
inhibitor O
for O
her O
breast O
cancer O
and O
discussions O
were O
begun O
to O
consider O
a O
possible O
course O
or O
two O
of O
Xeloda O
perhaps O
at O
a O
dose O
reduced O
scheduled O
if O
she O
continues O
to O
make O
progress O
in O
rehab O
and O
can O
return O
to O
Dr. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
a O
new O
pericardial O
effusion O
which O
was O
felt O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
secondary O
to O
metastatic O
cervical O
cancer O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
was O
scheduled O
and O
Cardiology O
was O
consulted O
. O

Echocardiogram O
showed O
moderate O
anterior O
pericardial O
effusion O
of O
approximately O
600 O
cc O
with O
diastolic O
indications O
of O
the O
right O
ventricle O
and O
low O

paradox O
. O

Cardiology O
did O
not O
feel O
that O
tamponade O
at O
this O
time O
was O
a O
concern O
and O
that O
a O
tap O
need O
not O
be O
performed O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
pulmonary O
wheezing O
, O
unknown O
origin O
, O
without O
history O
of O
asthma O
. O

Her O
steroids O
were O
tapered O
and O
Pulmonary O
was O
consulted O
who O
recommended O
a O
CT O
scan O
of O
the O
chest O
to O
evaluate O
the O
lung O

They O
felt O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
a O
malignant O
lymphangitic O
spread O
with O
pericardial O
involvement O
versus O
infectious O
, O
other O
cardiovascular O
causes O
, O
or O
viral O

. O

She O
had O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
repeated O
which O
showed O
an O
FEV1 O
of O
36% O
of O

She O
was O
continued O
on O
two O
liters O
of O
oxygen O
awaiting O
her O
CT O
scan O
on O
06/14 B-DATE
and O
she O
developed O
a O
new O
junctional O
rhythm O
with O
a O
question O
of O
a O
new O
rub O
versus O
murmur O
on O
examination O
. O

Cardiology O
felt O
she O
had O
a O
rub O
and O
her O
pulsus O
was O
still O
10 O
. O

EKG O
showed O
an O
ectopic O
low O
atrial O
P O
and O
they O
thought O
she O
was O
still O
stable O
without O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
. O

She O
should O
have O
a O
follow-up O
echocardiogram O
. O

Echocardiogram O
showed O
left O

the O
upper O
limits O
of O
normal O

without O
any O

in O
the O
effusion O
from O
06/11 B-DATE
. O

Thoracic O
Surgery O
was O
also O
consulted O
and O
they O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
a O
pericardial O
window O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She O
should O
be O
continued O
with O
pulmonary O
oximetry O
testing O
. O

She O
underwent O
her O
CT O
scan O
. O

This O
showed O
lymphangitic O
spread O
of O
cancer O
in O
the O
chest O
, O
question O
of O
pulmonary O
nodules O
in O
the O
chest O

and O
proximal O
ureter O
, O
and O
periaortic O
lymphadenopathy O
. O

Pulmonary O
felt O
this O
was O
consistent O
also O
with O
lymphangitic O
spread O
and O
they O
did O
not O
feel O
that O
a O
bronchoscopy O
would O
be O
of O
any O
assistance O
at O
this O
time O
. O

Chemotherapy O
for O
metastatic O
cervical O
cancer O
was O
discussed O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
she O
was O
started O
on O
5-FU O
800 O
mg O

days O
06/18 B-DATE
, O
06/19 B-DATE
, O
and O

. O

She O
also O
received O
Cisplatin O
35 O

squared O
on O
06/19 B-DATE
and O
Ifex O
and O
Mesna O
on O
06/18 B-DATE
. O

She O
was O
noted O
, O
on O
06/16 B-DATE
, O
to O
have O
numerous O
erythematous O
maculopapules O
on O
her O
back O
and O
chest O
. O

Dermatology O
was O
consulted O
and O
they O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
most O
likely O
steroid O
acne O
. O

They O
therefore O
felt O
a O
rapid O
steroid O
taper O
was O
indicated O
and O
topical O
Erythromycin O
if O
desired O
by O
the O
patient O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
wheezing O
continued O
but O
without O
change O
. O

Her O
cardiac O
examination O
remained O
the O
same O
and O
there O
continued O
to O
be O
no O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
. O

Cardiology O
felt O
that O
follow-up O
echo O
was O
indicated O
on O
06/18 B-DATE
as O
she O
had O
another O
echocardiogram O
which O
showed O
no O
change O
or O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
. O

They O
therefore O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
be O
continued O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
examination O
. O

She O
had O
some O
mental O
status O
changes O
with O
confusion O
and O
hallucinations O
on O
06/18 B-DATE
originating O
from O
narcotics O
versus O
decreased O

. O

The O
Ifex O
was O
held O
as O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
it O
could O
have O
precipitated O
the O
mental O
status O
changes O
and O
that O
she O
was O
to O
receive O
no O
further O
Ifex O
. O

She O
had O
no O
further O
hallucinations O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

1) O
NEUROLOGY O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
intensive O
monitoring O
due O
to O
his O
frail O
condition O
. O

He O
had O
an O
electroencephalogram O
performed O
on O
his O
initial O
admittance O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
which O
did O
not O
show O
any O
evidence O
of O
seizure O
activity O
. O

It O
did O
, O
however O
, O
show O
diffuse O
slowing O
. O

He O
was O
given O
1.5 O
grams O
of O
Dilantin O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
as O
well O
as O
2 O
mgs O
of O
intravenous O
Ativan O
which O
did O
little O
to O
stop O
his O
rhythmic O
blinking O
that O
he O
showed O
from O
time O
to O
time O
on O
examination O
. O

His O
hypertension O
; O
his O
high O
blood O
pressure O
was O
controlled O
with O
intravenous O
nitroglycerine O
in O
the O
early O
going O
and O
then O
he O
was O
switched O
to O
an O
oral O
regimen O
for O
better O
control O
after O
he O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
do O
well O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
and O
was O
quite O
surprisingly O
intact O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
his O
body O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
ability O
to O
move O
. O

He O
did O
consistently O
have O
more O
movement O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
body O
than O
on O
the O
right O
, O
but O
he O
gradually O
became O
more O
awake O
and O
alert O
and O
communicative O
and O
his O
endotracheal O
tube O
was O
removed O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
admission O
. O

His O
diagnosis O
of O
progressive O
supranuclear O
palsy O
was O
placed O
under O
question O
on O
further O
examination O
of O
his O
eye O
movement O
since O
he O
was O
able O
to O
have O
excellent O
superior O
gaze O
especially O
with O
the O
bells O
phenomenon O
which O
would O
not O
be O
seen O
with O
progressive O
supranuclear O
palsy O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
dementing O
illness O
and O
rigidity O
was O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
some O
type O
of O
cortico-basal O
ganglia O
degeneration O
process O
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
clarified O
during O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
Parkinson O
&apos;s O
disease O
, O
as O
he O
had O
no O
significant O
response O
to O
Eldopa O
in O
the O
past O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
tremor O
, O
although O
he O
was O
quite O
rigid O
and O
bradykinetic O
. O

He O
had O
an O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
performed O
on O
October B-DATE
18 I-DATE
, O
1996 O
. O

This O
showed O
the O
unchanged O
left O
temporal O
parenchymal O
interparenchymal O
hematoma O
and O
the O
old O
embolic O
right O
frontal O
infarct O
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
new O
lesions O
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
his O
susceptibility O
studies O
to O
suggest O
old O
bleeds O
which O
might O
have O
been O
consistent O
with O
amylase O
angiopathy O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
gadolinium O
scan O
did O
not O
show O
enhancement O
at O
the O
area O
of O
his O
hemorrhage O
, O
so O
tumor O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
unlikely O
. O

However O
, O
this O
issue O
will O
need O
to O
be O
re-evaluated O
in O
six O
months O
time O
once O
the O
hematoma O
is O
less O
prominent O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
possibly O
an O
underlying O
tumor O
or O
arterial O
venous O
malformation O
that O
could O
be O
currently O
compressed O
by O
the O
area O
of O
hemorrhage O
. O

The O
etiology O
of O
his O
bleed O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
hypertension O
, O
but O
these O
other O
causes O
could O
also O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

2) O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

His O
electrocardiogram O
was O
concerning O
for O
ischemia O
. O

He O
was O
on O
intravenous O
TNG O
and O
was O
supratherapeutic O
on O
his O
anti-coagulation O
. O

He O
did O
have O
a O
slight O
elevation O
of O
his O
TPK O
with O
an O
additional O
value O
of O
198 O
with O
a O
MB O
fraction O
of O
5.7 O
, O
which O
makes O
for O
a O
percentage O
of O
2.9 O
. O

That O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
percentage O
that O
he O
had O
and O
after O
this O
his O
percentage O
came O
down O
to O
1.6 O
, O
1.0 O
on O
subsequent O
CKMBs O
and O
was O
felt O
that O
he O
had O
a O
very O
small O
&quot; O
leaflet O
&quot; O
. O

He O
remained O
chest O
pain O
free O
throughout O
his O
admission O
. O

3) O
PULMONARY O
: O

After O
his O
initial O
intubation O
he O
remained O
quite O
stable O
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
be O
at O
a O
large O
aspiration O
risk O
given O
his O
decreased O
mental O
status O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
presence O
of O
a O
gag O
reflex O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
given O
aggressive O
pulmonary O
toilets O
including O
chest O
physical O
therapy O
and O
aspiration O
precautions O
and O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
develop O
any O
pulmonary O
symptoms O
during O
his O
admission O
. O

4) O
HEMATOLOGY O
: O

He O
had O
his O
prothrombin O
time O
reversed O
with O
Vitamin O
K O
2 O
mgs O
on O
admission O
subcutaneously O
as O
well O
as O
two O
units O
of O
fresh O
frozen O
plasma O
given O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O

His O
anticoagulation O
status O
had O
to O
be O
monitored O
very O
closely O
due O
to O
his O
history O
of O
deep O
venous O
thrombosis O
and O
pulmonary O
embolus O
as O
well O
as O
atrial O
fibrillation O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
a O
high O
amount O
of O
anticoagulation O
because O
of O
the O
new O
intraparenchymal O
bleed O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
his O
goal O
INR O
was O
to O
be O
2.0 O
. O

He O
did O
drop O
below O
1.5 O
at O
one O
time O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
was O
placed O
on O
heparin O
intravenous O
to O
carry O
him O
through O
that O
period O
, O
but O
his O
discharge O
INR O
was O
around O
2 O
and O
he O
was O
off O
of O
heparin O
at O
that O
time O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
have O
very O
close O
monitoring O
of O
his O
anticoagulation O
status O
in O
the O
future O
to O
prevent O
further O
problems O
. O

5) O
GASTROINTESTINAL O
: O

He O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
speech O
and O
swallow O
pathology O
group O
at O
the O
Ph B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
underwent O
conditioning O
with O
Cytoxan O
, O
VP-16 O
, O
and O
VCNU O
. O

His O
initial O
hospital O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
following O
: O

1. O
Fever O
and O
neutropenia O
: O

The O
patient O
developed O
fever O
and O
neutropenia O
without O
any O
clear O
source O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
multiple O
antibiotics O
including O
ceftazidime O
, O
gentamicin O
, O
vancomycin O
and O
ampho O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
fevers O
persisted O
until O
he O
no O
longer O
was O
neutropenic O
. O

2. O
Renal O
occlusive O
disease O
: O

Starting O
on O
approximately O
day O
14 O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
signs O
of O
renal O
occlusive O
disease O
with O
increasing O
bilirubin O
. O

This O
progressed O
inexorably O
until O
he O
developed O
massive O
ascites O
and O
marked O
hyperbilirubinemia O
. O

Multiple O
abdominal O
ultrasound O
revealed O
no O
biliary O
dilatation O
; O
there O
was O
evidence O
of O
gallbladder O
polyps O
versus O
stones O
on O
one O
ultrasound O
. O

Despite O
aggressive O
supportive O
care O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
liver O
pathology O
did O
not O
resolve O
and O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
progressive O
hepatic O
failure O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hospitalization O
, O
his O
bilirubins O
were O
in O
the O
high O
30&apos;s O
and O
low O
40&apos;s O
. O

3. O
Renal O
failure O
: O

Despite O
aggressive O
attempts O
to O
maintain O
his O
intravascular O
volume O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
renal O
function O
progressively O
declined O
. O

He O
received O
multiple O
transfusions O
with O
coloids O
, O
including O
red O
blood O
cells O
and O
albumin O
. O

Despite O
maximal O
efforts O
with O
coloids O
, O
renal O
range O
dopamine O
and O
Lasix O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
creatinine O
continued O
to O
rise O
. O

4. O
Respiratory O
: O

Because O
of O
mechanical O
limitations O
imposed O
by O
his O
ascites O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
severe O
tachypnea O
and O
required O
supplemental O
oxygen O
to O
maintain O
his O
oxygenation O
. O

Despite O
a O
very O
aggressive O
approach O
to O
his O
care O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
decline O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
close O
discussion O
with O
the O
family O
, O
he O
was O
made O
DNR O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
clinical O
situation O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
and O
he O
died O
on O
11/9 B-DATE

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
a O
53-year-old O
male O
with O
a O
longstanding O
history O
of O
renal O
disease O
with O
multiple O
complications O
and O
problems O
related O
to O
vascular O
access O
and O
hypercoagulable O
state O
. O

These O
culminated O
in O
an O
attempted O
cadaveric O
kidney O
transplant O
undertaken O
on O
12/16 B-DATE
97 O
, O
which O
was O
complicated O
by O
thrombosis O
and O
necrosis O
of O
the O
cadaveric O
renal O
vein O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
required O
a O
transplant O
nephrectomy O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
course O
was O
subsequently O
characterized O
by O
recurrent O
pneumonias O
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
aspiration O
, O
and O
by O
hemodynamic O
instability O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
from O
the O
Transplant O
Service O
for O
ventilatory O
management O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
hypotension O
. O

On O
transfer O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
sedated O
, O
but O
was O
unresponsive O
and O
extremely O
dyssynchronous O
with O
the O
ventilator O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
have O
substantial O
auto O
PEEP O
with O
an O
elevated O
dead O
space O
. O

A O
pulmonary O
arteriogram O
on O
01/03 B-DATE
98 O
demonstrated O
multiple O
pulmonary O
emboli O
, O
likely O
less O
than O
one O
week O
old O
, O
possibly O
introduced O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
renal O
vein O
thrombosis O
of O
12/19 B-DATE
97 O
. O

An O
inferior O
vena O
cava O
filter O
was O
placed O
; O
lower O
extremity O
noninvasive O
studies O
were O
negative O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
high O
pressures O
to O
ventilate O
adequately O
, O
possibly O
related O
to O
an O
abdominal O
compartment O
syndrome O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
undergone O
two O
abdominal O
procedures O
following O
explantation O
. O

The O
physiology O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transfer O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
was O
consistent O
with O
a O
septic O
process O
. O

CT O
scan O
demonstrated O
retroperitoneal O
collection O
containing O
both O
free O
air O
and O
extravasated O
contrast O
material O
. O

For O
the O
concern O
of O
a O
perforated O
viscus O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
on O
01/06 B-DATE
98 O
, O
during O
which O
the O
bowel O
was O
run O
without O
evidence O
of O
perforation O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
unstable O
. O

He O
was O
taken O
to O
fluoroscopy O
, O
where O
oral O
contrast O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
extravasating O
through O
a O
posterior O
duodenum O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
again O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
01/08 B-DATE
98 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
a O
gastrojejunostomy O
was O
performed O
with O
stapling O
across O
the O
gastroduodenal O
junction O
, O
introduction O
of O
five O
Jackson-Pratt O
drains O
into O
the O
retroperitoneal O
mass O
, O
cholecystotomy O
tube O
, O
gastrostomy O
tube O
, O
and O
jejunostomy O
tube O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an O
extensive O
estimated O
blood O
loss O
requiring O
multiple O
blood O
products O
and O
fluid O
resuscitation O
therapy O
. O

Accompanying O
this O
during O
this O
period O
were O
elevations O
in O
liver O
function O
studies O
and O
amylase O
and O
lipase O
consistent O
with O
pancreatic O
inflammation O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
aggressively O
treated O
with O
fluid O
resuscitation O
and O
pressors O
for O
his O
septic O
physiology O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
cardiac O
tamponade O
or O
specific O
underlying O
coronary O
dysfunction O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
appropriate O
antibiotics O
for O
his O
Serratia O
pneumonia O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
his O
abdominal O
process O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
have O
an O
underlying O
hypercoagulable O
state O
, O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
source O
for O
the O
repeated O
clots O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
bleeding O
problems O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
full O
heparinization O
would O
not O
be O
prudent O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
pneumo-boots O
and O
subcutaneous O
heparin O
. O

Attention O
was O
paid O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
metabolic O
and O
electrolyte O
abnormalities O
, O
which O
were O
corrected O
appropriately O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Mr. O
Less B-PATIENT
continued O
to O
remain O
critically O
ill O
with O
only O
very O
transient O
mild O
improvement O
with O
drainage O
of O
additional O
retroperitoneal O
fluid O
. O

He O
remained O
pressor O
dependent O
, O
as O
well O
as O
dependent O
upon O
mechanical O
ventilatory O
assistance O
. O

His O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
atrial O
fibrillation O
requiring O
cardioversion O
. O

He O
had O
an O
ongoing O
requirement O
for O
high O
volume O
resuscitation O
and O
was O
persistently O
acidotic O
despite O
CV-VVH O
in O
the O
face O
of O
bicarbonate O
replenishment O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
appeared O
to O
have O
stool O
from O
his O
Jackson-Pratt O
site O
and O
right O
oblique O
incision O
. O

Bloody O
drainage O
from O
his O
increasingly O
distended O
abdomen O
was O
noted O
. O

Extensive O
discussions O
were O
carried O
out O
with O
Mrs. O
Less B-PATIENT
condition O
was O
irretrievable O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
continued O
massive O
retroperitoneal O
contamination O
and O
probable O
multiple O
enteric O
fistulae O
from O
an O
ischemic O
bowel O
. O

Dr. O
Cantsleddjesc B-DOCTOR
felt O
that O
no O
surgical O
approach O
to O
this O
problem O
or O
further O
intervention O
or O
radiologic O
procedures O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

All O
physicians O
and O
the O
family O
were O
in O
agreement O
that O
the O
most O
appropriate O
approach O
was O
to O
institute O
comfort O
measures O
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
appeared O
to O
be O
comfortable O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
with O
his O
family O
at O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
, O
where O
he O
was O
noted O
initially O
to O
have O
a O
pulmonary O
wedge O
pressure O
of O
45 O
with O
a O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure O
of O
82/40 O
. O

This O
lowered O
with O
IV O
nitroglycerin O
. O

Selective O
coronary O
angiography O
showed O
an O
occluded O
right O
coronary O
artery O
in O
its O
midportion O
. O

He O
had O
an O
80% O
distal O
left O
main O
, O
a O
90% O
proximal O
circumflex O
, O
and O
multiple O
significant O
lesions O
in O
the O
LAD O
. O

His O
left O
ventricle O
ejection O
showed O
diffuse O
hypokinesis O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
Sligh B-PATIENT
. O

She O
noted O
that O
he O
was O
actively O
working O
full O
time O
and O
was O
a O
sales O
representative O
at O
the O
Leigh B-LOCATION
and O
lives O
at O
home O
with O
her O
and O
his O
daughter O
, O
age O
18 O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
evidence O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
the O
critical O
left O
main O
lesion O
, O
he O
should O
be O
admitted O
for O
further O
evaluation O
. O

Indeed O
, O
he O
was O
treated O
with O
diuretics O
and O
nitrates O
along O
with O
cessation O
of O
his O
aspirin O
, O
and O
he O
was O
put O
on O
IV O
Heparin O
. O

He O
stabilized O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

He O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
some O
ventricular O
ectopy O
on O
Holter O
monitor O
. O

He O
developed O
epigastric O
pain O
on O
07/31 B-DATE
which O
previously O
had O
been O
ignored O
but O
in O
retrospect O
was O
probably O
his O
anginal O
equivalent O
. O

He O
also O
had O
multifocal O
ventricular O
ectopy O
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
had O
some O
further O
anterolateral O
ST O
segment O
changes O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
did O
have O
unstable O
angina O
with O
his O
critical O
coronary O
anatomy O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Electrophysiology O
service O
, O
Dr. O
Slusslashgodle B-DOCTOR
, O
who O
said O
that O
he O
had O
no O
indication O
for O
patch O
placement O
at O
the O
time O
of O
surgery O
. O

On O
08/02 B-DATE
93 O
, O
an O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
was O
placed O
; O
then O
, O
Dr. O
Thorebreutz B-DOCTOR
took O
him O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
, O
where O
he O
had O
quadruple O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
grafting O
. O

He O
had O
a O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
graft O
of O
the O
LAD O
, O
a O
single O
saphenous O
vein O
to O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
with O
280 O
cc O
per O
minute O
flow O
, O
and O
a O
saphenous O
vein O
snake O
graft O
to O
the O
diagonal O
and O
circumflex O
with O
150 O
cc O
per O
minute O
flow O
. O

A O
paraphimosis O
was O
noted O
and O
treated O
by O
Dr. O
Ryna B-DOCTOR
Jescdrig I-DOCTOR
. O

After O
surgery O
he O
had O
a O
ongoing O
sinus O
tachycardia O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
be O
rapidly O
weaned O
and O
extubated O
. O

He O
had O
good O
hemodynamics O
. O

He O
had O
occasional O
atrial O
and O
ventricular O
premature O
beats O
. O

His O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
was O
weaned O
the O
following O
day O
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
out O
of O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Nutrition O
Service O
, O
who O
followed O
him O
for O
dietary O
management O
of O
his O
diabetes O
mellitus O
. O

On O
08/05 B-DATE
it O
was O
noted O
that O
his O
platelet O
count O
had O
fallen O
from O
171,000 O
to O
54,000 O
; O
this O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
intravenous O
Heparin O
and O
indeed O
, O
when O
Heparin O
was O
discontinued O
, O
since O
it O
had O
been O
restarted O
after O
surgery O
, O
his O
platelet O
count O
rebounded O
to O
normal O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
does O
have O
a O
thrombocytopenic O
reaction O
to O
Heparin O
. O

He O
remained O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

He O
did O
have O
runs O
of O
nonsustained O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
, O
which O
were O
clinically O
stable O
. O

He O
had O
a O
right O

the O
sigmoid O
colon O
, O
and O
also O
noted O
were O
firm O
and O
large O
periaortic O

surgery O
was O
not O
attempted O
. O

Postoperatively O

: O

In O
1990 O
the O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy O
in O
Hispit B-LOCATION
, I-LOCATION
Delaware I-LOCATION
. O

Since O
that O
time O
the O
patient O
has O
been O
treated O
medically O
. O

In O
07 B-DATE
93 O
the O
patient O
underwent O
exercise O

test O
which O
showed O
a O
MBO2 O
of O
12.7 O
mg O
per O
kilogram O
. O

On O
09 B-DATE
93 O
the O
patient O
underwent O
transplant O
evaluation O
at O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

Echocardiogram O
showed O
severe O
PR O
and O
mitral O
regurgitation O
, O
mild O
AI O
and O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
15% O
to O
20% O
, O
a O
markedly O
dilated O
left O
ventricle O
and O
moderately O
dilated O
right O
ventricle O
, O
and O
a O
question O
of O
a O
possible O
left O
ventricular O
and O
right O
ventricular O
thrombus O
. O

Consequently O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
Coumadin O
. O

Catheterization O
at O
that O
time O
showed O
an O
RA O
pressure O
of O
60 O
, O
cardiac O
index O
of O
1.7 O
, O
SVR O
of O
2100 O
and O
a O
PVR O
of O
387 O
. O

Coronaries O
were O
completely O
normal O
. O

Consequently O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
CCU O
for O
intensive O
hemodynamic O
monitoring O
, O
and O
after O
load O
reduction O
. O

In O
the O
CCU O
the O
patient O
was O
initially O
treated O
with O
nitroprusside O
and O
eventually O
switched O
to O
Captopril O
and O
Isordil O
. O

Hemodynamics O
were O
optimized O
resulting O
in O
a O
cardiac O
output O
of O
4.4 O
with O
a O
SVR O
of O
1300 O
and O
a O
wedge O
of O
16 O
. O

Pulmonary O
function O
tests O
were O
obtained O
which O
showed O
marked O
pulmonary O
dysfunction O
with O
FEV1 O
of O
1.4 O
and O
markedly O
decreased O
ELCL O
of O
50% O
. O

Repeat O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
following O
optimization O
of O
cardiac O
therapy O
showed O
somewhat O
improved O
but O
not O
to O
a O
significant O
degree O
of O
the O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
due O
to O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
long O
standing O
amiodarone O
therapy O
, O
and O
a O
positive O
second O
pulmonary O
function O
, O
Amiodarone O
was O
discontinued O
during O
that O
hospital O
admission O
. O

Consequently O
the O
patient O
was O
discharged O
on O
Captopril O
, O
Digoxin O
, O
Lasix O
, O
Micronase O
, O
Isordil O
and O
prn O
inhalers O
. O

The O
patient O
did O
well O
at O
home O
until O
1/31 B-DATE
94 O
when O
she O
was O
admitted O
to O
Souland B-HOSPITAL
in O
Nixmont B-LOCATION
Bovo I-LOCATION
with O
increasing O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
patient O
was O
aggressively O
diuresed O
. O

By O
report O
, O
in O
the O
interim O
since O
discharge O
from O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
, O
amiodarone O
was O
restarted O
for O
unclear O
indications O
. O

Dring O
this O
hospitalization O
at O
Hahkellrick B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
, O
a O
dobutamine O
drip O
was O
started O
to O
improve O
hemodynamics O
, O
and O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
the O
dobutamine O
drip O
the O
patient O
had O
spontaneous O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
/ O
ventricular O
fibrillation O
arrest O
. O

She O
was O
quickly O
defibrillated O
and O
converted O
to O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block O
. O

She O
was O
treated O
for O
a O
short O
time O
with O
Lidocaine O
and O
eventually O
weaned O
off O
. O

She O
was O
continued O
on O
low O

dobutamine O
and O
transferred O
back O
to O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
for O

. O

The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
on O
02/20 B-DATE
94 O
, O
again O
for O
possible O
heart-lung O
transplantation O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
CHF O
and O
Heart O
Transplant O
Service O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
likely O
a O
good O
transplant O
candidate O
secondary O
to O
endocurrent O
lung O
disease O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
since O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
failed O
amiodarone O
therapy O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
the O
Alllo B-HOSPITAL
Eino I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
which O
recommended O
EPS O
to O
rule O
out O
possible O
bundle O
branch O
reentry O
as O
the O
source O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
arrhythmia O
with O
possible O
AICD O
placement O
if O
the O
EPS O
was O
negative O
. O

Note O
, O
per O
recommendation O
from O
the O
CHF O
Team O
, O
dobutamine O
was O
discontinued O
within O
the O
first O
24 O
hours O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hospitalization O
without O
difficulty O
. O

On O
02/22 B-DATE
94 O
an O
EPS O
study O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
negative O
for O
inducible O
ventricular O
arrhythmias O
despite O
maximal O
stimulation O
. O

Consequently O
AICD O
placement O
was O
recommended O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
AICD O
placement O
on O
03/09 B-DATE
94 O
. O

Note O
, O
from O
02/22 B-DATE
to O
03/09 B-DATE
there O
is O
a O
question O
of O
the O
patient O
having O
a O
right O
forearm O
thrombophlebitis O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
a O
full O
2 O
week O
course O
of O
antibiotic O
therapy O
along O
with O
debridement O
of O
the O
right O
forearm O
for O
placement O
of O
the O
AICD O
. O

Note O
, O
biopsies O
from O
the O
right O
forearm O
were O
significant O
only O
for O
inflammation O
, O
and O
not O
infection O
. O

Cultures O
were O
negative O
, O
and O
note O
, O
no O
pus O
or O
purulent O
fluid O
was O
found O
upon O
debridement O
. O

Thus O
, O
AICD O
placement O
was O
performed O
on O
03/09 B-DATE
94 O
following O
a O
2 O
week O
course O
of O
antibiotic O
therapy O
for O
presumed O
( O
but O
later O
found O
to O
be O
inflammation O
only O
) O
of O
right O
forearm O
phlebitis O
. O

There O
were O
no O
intraoperative O
or O
postoperative O
complications O
following O
the O
AICD O
placement O
. O

By O
03/10 B-DATE
94 O
the O
patient O
was O
able O
to O
ambulate O
without O
assistance O
, O
and O
was O
only O
having O
minimal O
tenderness O
at O
the O
AICD O
placement O
site O
. O

At O
this O
point O
it O
was O
felt O
the O
patient O
would O
go O
home O
on O
03/13 B-DATE
94 O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
should O
stay O

Of I-HOSPITAL
with O
palpitations O
and O
was O
found O
to O
have O
an O
irregular O
wide O
complex O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
clearly O
was O
suffering O
from O
atrial O
arrhythmias O
conducting O
down O
his O
bypass O
tract O
which O
were O
difficult O
to O
manage O
and O
causing O
symptomatic O
palpitations O
. O

Given O
his O
known O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
and O
his O
recent O
heart O
failure O
and O
chest O
pain O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
was O
indicated O
prior O
to O
proceeding O
to O
an O
electrophysiology O
study O
. O

His O
initial O
cardiac O
catheterization O
had O
to O
be O
postponed O
given O
the O
possibility O
of O
an O
allergy O
to O
Prednisone O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
by O
Nnoatal B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
who O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
be O
safely O
treated O
with O
Solumedrol O
rather O
than O
Prednisone O
together O
with O
Benadryl O
and O
the O
use O
of O
low O
ionic O
contrast O
medium O
. O

Accordingly O
the O
patient O
underwent O
uneventful O
cardiac O
catheterization O
on O
9/17 B-DATE
98 O
which O
revealed O
a O
pulmonary O
capillary O
wedge O
pressure O
of O
25 O
and O
a O
left O
ventricular O
end O
diastolic O
pressure O
of O
20 O
. O

His O
right O
coronary O
artery O
was O
occluded O
and O
filled O
distally O
via O
left O
to O
right O
collaterals O
. O

He O
had O
a O
50% O
proximal O
left O
anterior O
descending O
stenosis O
and O
only O
minor O
disease O
to O
the O
left O
circumflex O
. O

His O
left O
ventriculogram O
showed O
preserved O
systolic O
function O
and O
mild O
mitral O
regurgitation O
. O

The O
patient O
then O
underwent O
an O
electrophysiology O
study O
on O
9/20 B-DATE
98 O
. O

There O
was O
no O
inducible O
supraventricular O
tachycardia O
but O
he O
did O
have O
evidence O
of O
a O
left O
lateral O
bypass O
tract O
. O

Mapping O
of O
the O
mitral O
anulus O
confirmed O
the O
location O
of O
the O
bypass O
tract O
. O

Radiofrequency O
ablation O
was O
applied O
there O
and O
resulted O
in O
the O
elimination O
of O
the O
preoperatively-excitation O
. O

There O
were O
no O
complications O
. O

Following O
the O
procedure O
there O
was O
no O
further O
evidence O
of O
wide O
complex O
tachycardia O
. O

He O
still O
did O
have O
occasional O
short O
runs O
of O
atrial O
tachycardia O
but O
there O
were O
no O
associated O
palpitations O
. O

In O
following O
up O
his O
ablation O
he O
underwent O
a O
Holter O
monitor O
which O
showed O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
rates O
of O
40 O
to O
80 O
. O

There O
were O
15 O
atrial O
runs O
the O
longest O
of O
which O
was O
13 O
beats O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
100 O
. O

He O
also O
underwent O
a O
post-procedural O
echocardiogram O
which O
showed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
61% O
with O
mild O
mitral O
regurgitation O
and O
left O
atrial O
enlargement O
at O
45mm O
. O

Following O
the O
procedure O
his O
QT O
interval O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
prolonged O
to O
approximately O
.55 O
seconds O
. O

His O
Sotalol O
was O
therefore O
decreased O
to O
120 O
mg O
bid O
and O
his O
QT O
and O
QTC O
intervals O
decreased O
to O
.45-.48 O
seconds O
. O

After O
the O
procedure O
he O
was O
started O
on O
Heparin O
and O
loaded O
on O
Coumadin O
for O
a O
period O
of O
the O
next O
3-4 O
weeks O
following O
radiofrequency O
ablation O
. O

His O
INR O
was O
2.3 O
prior O
to O
discharge O
and O
he O
was O
scheduled O
to O
follow-up O
with O
the O
Anticoagulation O
Clinic O
to O
follow O
his O
Coumadin O
dose O
. O

Finally O
, O
his O
dementia O
appeared O
to O
worsen O
following O
receiving O
medications O
for O
agitation O
during O
his O
EP O
study O
. O

Accordingly O
he O
was O
seen O
by O
Neurology O
who O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
secondary O
process O
. O

He O
did O
have O
a O
head O
CT O
which O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
bleed O
or O
stroke O
. O

Finally O
, O
his O
blood O
pressure O
had O
trended O
up O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
particularly O
with O
the O
decreased O
dose O
of O
Sotalol O
. O

Given O
his O
occasional O
sinus O
bradycardia O
his O
Atenolol O
was O
not O
advanced O
but O
instead O
his O
Zestril O
dose O
was O
increased O
from O
10-20 O
mg O
bid O
and O
his O
blood O
pressure O
responded O
appropriately O
. O

AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O

and O
was O
transfused O
two O
units O
of O
packed O
red O

to O
approximately O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
10/3 B-DATE
96 O
at O
10:30 O

which O
was O
down O
from O
her O
baseline O
of O

. O

The O
lungs O
had O
mild O
bibasilar O
rales O
, O
superimposed O
over O
baseline O
wheezes O
. O

It O
was O
thought O
that O
she O
may O
have O
a O
touch O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
secondary O
to O
transfusion O
. O

Her O
intravenous O
fluids O
were O
held O
and O
her O

showed O
clear O
lungs O
with O
respect O
to O
congestive O

. O

Therefore O
the O
idea O
of O
pulmonary O

was O
entertained O
although O
the O

had O
no O
episodes O
of O
tachycardia O
, O
chest O
pain O
or O
hemoptysis O
with O
her O

10/4 B-DATE
96 O
and O
rectal O
carcinoma O
was O
observed O
and O
cauterized O
with O
a O

. O

This O
provided O
adequate O
hemostasis O
. O

The O
patient O

EPIGLOTTITIS O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

This O
is O
an O
87 O
year O
old O
white O
female O
who O
is O
otherwise O
healthy O
by O
history O
and O
presented O
with O
a O
several O
day O
history O
of O
upper O
respiratory O
infection O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
smoke O
and O
does O
not O
drink O
. O

She O
was O
seen O
by O
her O
local O
internist O
after O
having O
several O
days O
of O
blood-tinged O
sputum O
which O
she O
was O
coughing O
up O
and O
some O
mild O
throat O
discomfort O
. O

She O
did O
not O
complain O
of O
significant O
pain O
and O
was O
able O
to O
tolerate O
p.o.s. O

She O
denied O
any O
respiratory O
distress O
although O
her O
family O
thought O
she O
may O
have O
had O
some O
labored O
breathing O
at O
one O
point O
. O

She O
was O
seen O
by O
her O
local O
physician O
who O
was O
concerned O
that O
she O
may O
have O
a O
malignancy O
secondary O
to O
the O
history O
of O
hemoptysis O
and O
throat O
discomfort O
. O

He O
recommended O
that O
she O
see O
a O
local O
otolaryngologist O
. O

Examination O
by O
the O
local O
otolaryngologist O
appareantly O
revealed O
significant O
swelling O
in O
the O
epiglottic O
area O
although O
we O
had O
no O
true O
record O
of O
what O
was O
seen O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
question O
of O
a O
carcinomatous O
lesion O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
epiglottis O
. O

Apparently O
the O
findings O
were O
significant O
enough O
to O
cause O
this O
otolaryngologist O
to O
recommend O
that O
the O
family O
bring O
the O
patient O
emergently O
to O
Ez B-HOSPITAL
Ephtro I-HOSPITAL
Health I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
where O
she O
be O
admitted O
for O
steroids O
and O
antibiotics O
and O
apparently O
the O
question O
of O
a O
tracheostomy O
was O
raised O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
granddaughter O
, O
however O
, O
works O
at O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
and O
therefore O
the O

elected O
to O

the O
patient O
home O
and O
then O
bring O
her O
to O
Retelk B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

She O
presented O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
with O
some O
throat O
discomfort O
, O
some O
mild O
hoarseness O
, O
which O
she O
said O
had O
been O
progressing O
over O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

She O
was O
sitting O
straight O
upright O
although O
was O
not O

distress O
. O

She O
did O
report O
a O

the O
back O
of O
her O
throat O
. O

She O
was O
febrile O
to O
101.7 O
. O

was O
obtained O
. O

A O
lateral O

amount O
of O
base O
of O
tongue O
edema O
with O
minimally O
visible O
epiglottis O
which O
was O
also O
significantly O
edematous O
and O
no O
distinct O
mass O
or O
lesion O
could O
be O
noted O
. O

She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
SICU O
where O
she O
was O
kept O
sedated O
and O
was O
given O
Ceftriaxone O
one O
gram O
q. O
12 O
h. O
as O
well O
as O
IV O
steroids O
for O
the O
first O
24 O
hours O
consisting O
of O
Decadron O
8 O
mg O
q. O
8 O
h. O
X O
3 O
doses O
in O
addition O
to O
10 O
mg O
that O
she O
received O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
on O
the O
way O
down O
to O
the O
Operating O
Room O
. O

Her O
initial O
hospital O
course O
while O
intubated O
was O
significant O
for O
an O
episode O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
which O
she O
went O
into O
in O
the O
Operating O
Room O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
case O
she O
had O
had O
a O
central O
line O
placed O
also O
for O
frequent O
blood O
draws O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
SICU O
house O
office O
. O

Her O
episode O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
as O
we O
planned O
to O
take O
her O
from O
the O
Operating O
Room O
after O
both O
the O
intubation O
and O
central O
line O
placement O
had O
been O
completed O
. O

She O
had O
no O
trouble O
with O
blood O
pressure O
with O
this O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
rates O
going O
up O
to O
150 O
. O

She O
was O
given O
a O
dose O
of O
Digoxin O
but O
broke O
spontaneously O
approximately O
two O
minutes O
after O
the O
Digoxin O
was O
given O
. O

EKG O
and O
enzymes O
were O
obtained O
and O
showed O
the O
first O
degree O
AV O
block O
that O
she O
had O
had O
on O
her O
preoperative O
EKG O
but O
no O
other O
findings O
at O
all O
. O

She O
continued O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
ICU O
where O
she O
was O
monitored O
. O

Her O
blood O
gases O
and O
O2 O
saturations O
correlated O
well O
and O
we O
used O
O2 O
saturations O
to O
follow O
her O
as O
well O
as O
venous O
gases O
and O
she O
continued O
to O
maintain O
good O
O2 O
saturation O
. O

She O
was O
kept O
ventilated O
because O
she O
was O
kept O
sedated O
. O

She O
went O
into O
an O
SVT O
the O
afternoon O
after O
intubation O
and O
a O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
Digitalize O
her O
, O
keeping O
her O
level O
between O
approximately O
.6 O
and O
1 O
. O

She O
continued O
in O
sinus O
rhythm O
after O
this O
episode O
of O
SVT O
and O
again O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
her O
blood O
pressure O
during O
that O
. O

Her O
edema O
decreased O
over O
the O
next O
two O
days O
and O
repeat O
fiberoptic O
examination O
on O
both O
4/3 B-DATE
and O
4/4 B-DATE
revealed O
decreasing O
edema O
. O

On O
4/5 B-DATE
91 O
in O
the O
ICU O
under O
controlled O
conditions O
, O
she O
was O
electively O
extubated O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

She O
was O
kept O
on O
Ceftriaxone O
but O
no O
further O
steroids O
were O
given O
. O

Examination O
at O
that O
time O
revealed O
question O
of O
a O
lesion O
at O
the O
left O
lateral O
glossoepiglottic O
fold O
. O

Otherwise O
her O
examination O
was O
normal O
with O
good O
visualization O
of O
the O
larynx O
and O
significant O
decrease O
in O
size O
of O
the O
epiglottis O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
during O
her O
first O
hospital O
day O
when O
she O
received O
steroids O
her O
blood O
sugars O
did O
increase O
significantly O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
started O
on O
insulin O
. O

Once O
the O
steroids O
were O
stopped O
, O
the O
insulin O
was O
able O
to O
be O
stopped O
. O

Tube O
feedings O
were O
started O
on O
4/3 B-DATE
91 O
and O
the O
NG O
tube O
was O
discontinued O
on O
4/5 B-DATE
91 O
prior O
to O
extubation O
to O
give O
a O
better O
look O
at O
the O
epiglottis O
prior O
to O
extubating O
her O
. O

After O
extubation O
she O
was O
watched O
in O
the O
ICU O
for O
24 O
hours O
and O
she O
did O
well O
except O
for O
some O
episodes O
of O
confusion O
happening O
the O
night O
of O
extubation O
and O
also O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Again O
, O
MI O
was O
ruled O
out O
and O
metabolic O
tests O
were O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

O2 O
saturations O
looked O
good O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
a O
mild O
episode O
of O
ICU O
psychosis O
. O

She O
was O
followed O
on O
the O
regular O
floor O
24 O
hours O
after O
extubation O
and O
had O
no O
further O
problems O
with O
her O
airway O
. O

She O
was O
maintained O
on O
Ceftriaxone O
and O
then O
switched O
to O
Augmentin O
and O
remained O
afebrile O
. O

Her O
white O
counts O
came O
down O
. O

Blood O
cultures O
which O
had O
been O
drawn O
at O
the O
time O
of O
intubation O
were O
negative O
. O

She O
had O
a O
geriatric O
consult O
due O
to O
her O
confusion O
and O
they O
suggested O
as O
we O
had O
already O
done O
to O
stop O
all O
sedatives O
and O
sleeping O
medications O
. O

Cardiology O
was O
contacted O
and O
recommended O
that O
given O
her O
history O
she O
should O
be O
taken O
off O
all O
Digoxin O
and O
just O
watched O
and O
that O
her O
SVTs O
may O
have O
been O
just O
secondary O
to O
stress O
of O
intubation O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
episodes O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
SVT O
were O
apparently O
not O
documented O
well O
enough O
in O
terms O
of O
EKG O
strips O
to O
aid O
Cardiology O
and O
therefore O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
an O
informal O
consult O
so O
that O
no O
formal O
consult O
will O
be O
found O
in O
this O
chart O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
their O
input O
was O
greatly O
appreciated O
and O
she O
was O
taken O
off O
of O
Digoxin O
and O
had O
no O
further O
problems O
with O
her O
heart O
. O

Her O
mental O
status O
began O
to O
clear O
under O
the O
family O
&apos;s O
request O
. O

DISPOSITION O
: O

On O
4/9 B-DATE
91 O
she O
was O
sent O
home O
on O
a O
week O
of O
Augmentin O
and O
will O
followup O
in O
the O
ENT O
Clinic O
. O

Our O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
establish O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
truly O
had O
an O
epiglottic O
lesion O
. O

She O
, O
of O
note O
, O
had O
no O
history O
of O
foreign O
body O
ingestion O
or O
any O
abrasion O
or O
trauma O
to O
this O
area O
. O

If O
she O
does O
have O
a O
lesion O
, O
then O
we O
may O
entertain O
, O
given O
her O
age O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
radiating O
this O
lesion O
as O
opposed O
to O
putting O
her O
through O
laryngectomy O
. O

Discharge O
medications O
are O
Augmentin O
500 O
mg O
t.i.d. O
X O
7 O
days O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
to O
followup O
in O
the O
ENT O
Clinic O
in O
approximately O
one O
week O
. O

of O
a O
Klatskin O
tumor O
, O
who O
returns O
with O
persistent O
jaundice O
and O
right O
upper O
quadrant O
pain O
. O

The O
present O
illness O
is O
marked O
by O
presentation O
with O
jaundice O
and O
pain O
in O
August B-DATE
of O
1994 O
, O
and O
a O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
that O
showed O
bile O
duct O
dilatation O
. O

In O
September B-DATE
1994 O
, O
he O
had O
an O
endoscopic O
retrograde O
cholangiopancreatography O
that O
shoed O
obstruction O
at O
the O
confluence O
of O
the O
left O
and O
right O
hepatic O
ducts O
. O

In O
October B-DATE
1994 O
, O
the O
Klatskin O
tumor O
was O
resected O
and O
it O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
moderately O
differentiated O
cholangiocarcinoma O
. O

The O
surgical O
margins O
were O
positive O
and O
he O
was O
treated O
postoperatively O
with O
radiation O
therapy O
and O
chemotherapy O
. O

He O
was O
admitted O
in O
January B-DATE
1994 O
, O
for O
biliary O
drainage O
catheter O
placement O
and O
balloon O
dilatation O
of O
what O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
an O
anastomotic O
stricture O
. O

Biopsies O
and O
fine O
needle O
aspirates O
were O
suspicious O
for O
recurrent O
cholangiocarcinoma O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
he O
had O
been O
persistently O
jaundiced O
and O
fatigued O
, O
until O
three O
weeks O
prior O
to O
admission O
when O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
biliary O
tube O
check O
, O
which O
showed O
things O
to O
be O
patent O
despite O
his O
rising O
bilirubin O
. O

He O
presented O
now O
for O
evaluation O
of O
failed O
biliary O
drainage O
. O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION O
: O

On O
physical O
examination O
, O
he O
had O
a O
normal O
temperature O
and O
blood O
pressure O
. O

His O
lungs O
were O
clear O
. O

His O
head O
and O
neck O
showed O
marked O
scleral O
icterus O
and O
a O
cardiac O
examination O
showed O
a O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
. O

The O
abdomen O
was O
soft O
and O
had O
well O
healed O
right O
upper O
quadrant O
scar O
. O

The O
extremities O
were O
unremarkable O
. O

Rectal O
examination O
was O
negative O
and O
his O
neurological O
examination O
was O
intact O
. O

LABORATORY O
DATA O
: O

His O
hematocrit O
was O
25.8% O
, O
with O
a O
normal O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
. O

His O
bilirubin O
was O
total O
11.1 O
, O
with O
a O
direct O
bilirubin O
of O
10.2 O
and O
his O
alkaline O
phosphatase O
was O
2,188 O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

He O
was O
admitted O
and O
started O
on O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
and O
studied O
with O
an O
abdominal O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
. O

The O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
showed O
dilated O
left O
and O
right O
hepatic O
ducts O
and O
was O
consistent O
with O
some O
form O
of O
blockage O
of O
the O
drainage O
arrangement O
. O

What O
then O
ensued O
was O
multiple O
attempts O
to O
insure O
adequate O
biliary O
decompression O
by O
use O
of O
percutaneous O
transhepatic O
cholangiogram O
and O
placement O
of O
biliary O
catheters O

Subsequent O
to O
that O
, O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
subhepatic O
fluid O
collection O
, O
which O
was O
suspicious O
for O
a O
bile O
leak O
and O
therefore O
a O
drain O
was O
placed O
percutaneously O
into O
this O
collection O
. O

On O
3/31 B-DATE
95 O
and O
04/04 B-DATE
95 O
, O
very O
mild O
revisions O
were O
made O
of O
these O
and O
the O
feeling O
was O
that O
solution O
had O
been O
reached O
with O
good O
drainage O
. O

His O
bilirubin O
by O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
had O
fallen O
from O
a O
peak O
of O
28 O
down O
to O
a O
discharge O
value O
of O
8 O
. O

He O
was O
feeling O
much O
better O
, O
taking O

COMPLAINT O
: O

Cean B-PATIENT
Leach I-PATIENT
is O
a O
38 O
year O
old O
male O
who O
is O
admitted O
in O
transfer O
from O
the O
Morehegron B-HOSPITAL
Valley I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
in O
Ville B-LOCATION
, I-LOCATION
Virginia I-LOCATION
for O
further O
evaluation O
and O
management O
of O
accelerating O
chest O
pains O
syndrome O
. O

Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
has O
a O
long O
and O
complex O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
. O

He O
was O
without O
known O
cardiovascular O
illness O
until O
he O
suffered O
an O
acute O
anterior O
myocardial O
infarction O
in O
August B-DATE
of O
l988 O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
at O
that O
time O
with O
TPA O
. O

A O
subsequent O
cardiac O
catheterization O
revealed O
a O
90% O
lesion O
in O
his O
proximal O
left O
anterior O
descending O
coronary O
artery O
and O
minor O
disease O
elsewhere O
in O
his O
coronary O
distribution O
. O

His O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
in O
the O
mid-50&apos;s. O

Because O
of O
angina O
following O
that O
catheterization O
, O
he O
ultimately O
underwent O
percutaneous O
transluminal O
coronary O
angioplasty O
of O
his O
left O
anterior O
descending O
coronary O
artery O
. O

He O
did O
well O
until O
he O
developed O
recurrent O
angina O
in O
March B-DATE
of O
l991 O
at O
which O
time O
repeat O
catheterization O
demonstrated O
restenosis O
of O
his O
left O
anterior O
descending O
and O
he O
underwent O
a O
second O
PTCA O
with O
good O
results O
. O

He O
again O
did O
well O
until O
approximately O
late O
l992 O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
, O
he O
has O
had O
multiple O
admissions O
to O
George&apos;sdgot B-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
with O
recurrent O
chest O
pain O
. O

He O
has O
ruled O
in O
for O
small O
R O
Q O
wave O
myocardial O
infarctions O
on O
many O
but O
not O
all O
of O
these O
occasions O
. O

He O
has O
had O
a O
progressive O
decline O
in O
his O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
as O
measured O
by O
non-invasive O
means O
with O
an O
echo O
ejection O
fraction O
in O
the O
low O
40&apos;s O
and O
radionuclide O
ejection O
fraction O
estimated O
in O
August B-DATE
of O
l994 O
at O
31% O
. O

He O
was O
admitted O
to O
George&apos;sdgot B-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
with O
a O
typical O
episode O
of O
this O
discomfort O
in O
October B-DATE
of O
l994 O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
at O
that O
time O
to O
the O
Ph B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Of I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

That O
was O
his O
first O
Ph B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Of I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
admission O
. O

Because O
of O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
history O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
multiple O
cardiac O
catheterizations O
prior O
to O
that O
transfer O
had O
failed O
to O
demonstrate O
fixed O
epicardial O
coronary O
disease O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
should O
undergo O
provocative O
testing O
to O
evaluate O
whether O
or O
not O
he O
had O
coronary O
artery O
spasm O
and O
/ O
or O
impaired O
coronary O
flow O
reserve O
. O

His O
angiograms O
from O
Morehegron B-HOSPITAL
Valley I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
from O
his O
four O
prior O
catheterizations O
were O
reviewed O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
gradually O
tapered O
off O
all O
of O
his O
vasoactive O
medications O
. O

He O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Catheter O
Laboratory O
on O
October B-DATE
13 I-DATE
, O
1994 O
. O

There O
he O
had O
a O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
with O
unremarkable O
intercardiac O
pressures O
. O

Repeat O
coronary O
angiography O
once O
again O
failed O
to O
demonstrate O
any O
significant O
obstructive O
lesions O
in O
either O
his O
dominant O
right O
coronary O
artery O
or O
his O
left O
coronary O
system O
. O

He O
then O
underwent O
a O
Doppler O
Coronary O
Flow O
study O
which O
demonstrated O
impaired O
coronary O
flow O
reserve O
. O

Specifically O
, O
his O
coronary O
flow O
maximally O
increased O
by O
a O
factor O
of O
2-2.5 O
whereas O
a O
normal O
response O
is O
considered O
to O
a O
3-4 O
fold O
increasing O
in O
coronary O
flow O
to O
maximal O
stimulus O
. O

Following O
the O
coronary O
flow O
studies O
, O
he O
was O
given O
greater O
doses O
of O
intracoronary O
ergonovine O
to O
assess O
his O
susceptibility O
to O
coronary O
artery O
spasm O
. O

He O
had O
a O
normal O
response O
to O
ergonovine O
that O
is O
he O
had O
diffuse O
narrowing O
of O
his O
coronary O
arteries O
without O
induction O
of O
focal O
spasm O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
develop O
typical O
anginal O
discomfort O
which O
was O
easily O
reversed O
with O
intracoronary O
nitroglycerin O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
time O
that O
this O
study O
was O
most O
consistent O
with O
a O
syndrome O
of O
impaired O
coronary O
flow O
reserve O
or O
microvascular O
angina O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
increasing O
doses O
of O
two O
calcium O
channel O
blockers O
and O
gradually O
ambulated O
in O
the O
hall O
without O
discomfort O
and O
was O
discharged O
to O
home O
. O

Following O
that O
admission O
in O
October B-DATE
he O
had O
a O
symptom O
free O
interval O
which O
lasted O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
. O

Starting O
in O
the O
October B-DATE
of O
l994 O
, O
he O
once O
again O
started O
having O
recurrences O
of O
his O
typical O
anginal O
discomfort O
. O

This O
occurred O
at O
rest O
and O
with O

. O

He O
had O

. O

His O
chest O
was O
clear O
and O
his O
carotids O
were O
brisk O
and O
his O
cardiac O
examination O
revealed O
a O
soft O
systolic O

. O

His O
abdomen O
was O
obese O
with O
no O
palpable O
organomegaly O
. O

His O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

the O
primary O
concern O
upon O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
transfer O
was O
that O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
had O
multiple O
previous O
catheterizations O
over O
the O
prior O
two O
years O
that O
he O
may O
have O
redeveloped O
obstructive O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
. O

It O
was O
; O
therefore O
, O
felt O
appropriate O
to O
start O
his O
repeat O
work-up O
by O
repeating O
his O
cardiac O
catheterization O
and O
coronary O
angiography O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Cardiac O
Catheterization O
Laboratory O
on O
4-10 B-DATE
94 O
, O
there O
he O
underwent O
right O
and O
left O
heart O
catheterization O
, O
coronary O
angiography O
and O
left O
ventriculography O
. O

The O
right O
heart O
catheter O
which O
was O
done O
using O
a O
Swanz O
Ganz O
catheter O
advanced O
to O
8 O
French O
sheath O
and O
right O
femoral O
vein O
revealed O
a O
mean O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
3 O
mm O
of O
mercury O
and O
a O
pulmonary O
capillary O
wedge O
pressure O
of O
12 O
mm O
of O
mercury O
. O

The O
left O
ventricular O
pressure O
was O
l05/12 O
. O

Coronary O
angiography O
revealed O
a O
picture O
which O
was O
essentially O
unchanged O
from O
October B-DATE
of O
l994 O
. O

That O
is O
there O
was O
no O
obstructive O
large O
vessel O
or O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
although O
there O
were O
some O
diffuse O
luminal O
irregularities O
. O

Left O
ventriculography O
revealed O
a O
large O
area O
of O
antero O
lateral O
and O
apical O
hypokinesis O
to O
akinesis O
with O
an O
estimated O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
35% O
. O

Impression O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
catheterization O
was O
that O
the O
precise O
etiology O
of O
his O
chest O
pain O
remained O
rather O
enigmatic O
. O

He O
was O
; O
therefore O
, O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Lato B-DOCTOR
Tikfreierm I-DOCTOR
of O
the O
Hematology O
Service O
to O
evaluate O
him O
further O
for O
a O
possible O
hypocoagulable O
condition O
versus O
primary O
and O
secondary O
platelet O
abnormality O
which O
could O
explain O
his O
recurrent O
coronary O
events O
. O

After O
an O
extensive O
evaluation O
including O
in O
vitro O
testing O
and O
flow O
cytometry O
of O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
platelets O
, O
it O
was O
ultimately O
determined O
that O
he O
did O
in O
fact O
have O
a O
primary O
platelet O
defect O
. O

Specifically O
, O
his O
platelets O
were O
not O
affected O
by O
aspirin O
and O
showed O
spontaneous O
hyperaggragability O
. O

This O
was O
utilized O
in O
making O
some O
changes O
in O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
regiment O
. O

Specifically O
his O
aspirin O
was O
discontinued O
and O
he O
was O
put O
back O
on O
ticlopidine O
at O
a O
higher O
than O
ordinary O
dose O
at O
500 O
mg. O
b.i.d. O

Repeat O
in O
vitro O
testing O
of O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
platelets O
suggested O
that O
although O
they O
remained O
refractory O
to O
aspirin O
, O
they O
did O
demonstrate O
reduced O
hyperaggragability O
spontaneously O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
possible O
reflective O
of O
the O
ticlopidine O
effect O
. O

While O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
Mr. O
Leach B-PATIENT
continued O
to O
nearly O
daily O
episodes O
of O
chest O
pain O
. O

These O
were O
generally O
spontaneous O
in O
nature O
and O
lasted O
anywhere O
from O
several O
minutes O
to O
nearly O
an O
hour O
duration O
. O

There O
were O
typically O
improved O
but O
not O
completely O
eradicated O
with O
sublingual O
nitroglycerin O
and O
generally O
required O
i.v. O
narcotics O
for O
complete O
pain O
relief O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
ongoing O
nature O
of O
his O
pain O
. O

Multiple O
changes O
and O
additions O
were O
made O
to O
his O
drug O
regimen O
. O

He O
was O
tried O
on O
theophylline O
and O
imipramine O
without O
real O
change O
in O
his O
chest O
pain O
syndrome O
. O

He O
was O
tried O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
combinations O
of O
calcium O
channel O
blockers O
including O
amlodipine O
and O
diltiazem O
and O
lodipine O
and O
verapamil O
. O

Amlodipine O
and O
bepridil O
all O
without O
marked O
change O
in O
his O
clinical O
syndrome O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
his O
hypercoagulable O
work-up O
revealed O
that O
he O
had O
nearly O
normal O
levels O
of O
clotting O
factors O
, O
specifically O
, O
his O
antithrombin O
3 O
of O
level O
was O
lll O
with O
a O
reference O
range O
of O
80-120 O
. O

Protein O
C O
was O
85 O
with O
a O
reference O
range O
of O
70-140 O
. O

Protein O
S O
was O
l14 O
with O
a O
reference O
range O
of O
70-140 O
. O

Plasminogen O
was O
slightly O
high O
at O
l51 O
with O
upper O
limit O
of O
normal O
being O
l30 O
. O

Factor O
8 O
was O
likewise O
slightly O
high O
at O
249 O
with O
a O
reference O
range O
of O
50-200 O
. O

Thrombin O
time O
and O
repalase O
time O
were O
normal O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
these O
results O
were O
non-specific O
and O
may O
represent O
just O
an O
acute O
phase O
reactants O
. O

His O
anti-cardio O
lipen O
antibodies O
both O
IGM O
and O
IGG O
were O
within O
normal O
range O
. O

His O
APC O
resistance O
was O
normal O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
both O
Rheumatology O
and O
Endocrinology O
to O
evaluate O
the O
possibility O
of O
primary O
connective O
tissue O
disease O
an O
/ O
or O
possible O
a O
theochromocytoma O
. O

Rheumatology O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
good O
evidence O
of O
a O
primary O
vasculitic O
process O
as O
the O
source O
of O
his O
presumed O
small O
vessell O
coronary O
disease O
and O
no O
further O
rheumatologic O
work-up O
was O
undertaken O
. O

He O
had O
multiple O
24 O
hour O
urine O
tests O
performed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
question O
of O
theochromocytoma O
, O
these O
demonstrated O
mild O
elevations O
of O
some O
urinary O
catacholomines O
, O
but O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
could O
well O
represent O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
complex O
medical O
regimen O
that O
he O
was O
having O
as O
well O
as O
the O
recurrent O
episodes O
of O
pain O
themselves O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
that O
he O
had O
good O
evidence O
of O
theochromocytoma O
. O

His O
compliment O
levels O
were O
normal O
and O
he O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
hepatitis O
, O
B O
serologies O
which O
also O
measured O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
some O
chronic O
inflammatory O
process O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
persistent O
nature O
of O
his O
pain O
and O
the O
inability O
to O
control O
it O
adequately O
on O
constantly O
changing O
a O
quite O
complex O
medical O
regimen O
, O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
a O
sympathetic O
blockade O
be O
performed O
as O
a O
method O
of O
controlling O
his O
chest O
pain O
syndrome O
. O

To O
evaluate O
the O
efficacy O
of O
this O
prior O
to O
commiting O
him O
to O
a O
permanent O
blockade O
procedure O
, O
a O

ten O
minutes O
of O
a O
standard O
protocol O
and O
stopped O
because O
of O
fatigue O
; O
although O
he O
had O
no O
significant O
ST O
changes O
with O

, O
he O
did O
experience O
his O
typical O
anginal O
chest O
discomfort O
which O
was O
ultimately O
relieved O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
sublingual O
nitroglycerin O
and O
i.v. O
morphine O
sulfate O
. O

On O
the O
basis O

at O
the O
level O
of O

. O

This O
produced O
a O
good O
sympathetic O
block O
with O
evidence O
of O
a O
rise O
in O
temperature O
in O
the O
left O
arm O
and O
ptosis O
and O
myosis O
of O
the O
left O

repeat O
exercise O
testing O
was O
done O

exercised O
for O
ten O
minutes O
achieved O
the O
same O
rate O
pressure O
product O
and O
had O
no O
chest O
discomfort O
. O

This O
encouraged O
his O
care O
takers O
to O
pursue O
a O
more O
permanent O
sympathetic O
blockade O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
and O
underwent O
resection O
and O
grafting O
of O
a O
thoracoabdominal O
aneurysm O
which O
she O
tolerated O
well O
. O

There O
were O
no O
intraoperative O
complications O
. O

She O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
postoperatively O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
procedure O
was O
also O
remarkable O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
underwent O
spinal O
cooling O
during O
this O
procedure O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
intubated O
postoperatively O
. O

She O
had O
a O
stable O
first O
postoperative O
day O
without O
evidence O
of O
hemodynamic O
or O
cardiopulmonary O
deterioration O
. O

On O
postoperative O
day O
1 O
she O
had O
a O
slight O
hematocrit O
drop O
to O
27.2 O
which O
was O
expected O
with O
hydration O
in O
addition O
to O
intraoperative O
volume O
loss O
but O
otherwise O
had O
an O
unremarkable O
course O
. O

Epidural O
anesthesia O
was O
used O
throughout O
her O
course O
for O
pain O
management O
and O
she O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Surgical O
floor O
on O
postoperative O
day O
two O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
an O
episode O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
physical O
examination O
consistent O
with O
only O
mild O
cardiopulmonary O
congestion O
as O
manifested O
by O
bilateral O
scattered O
rales O
in O
the O
lung O
fields O
. O

Serum O
electrolytes O
at O
the O
time O
revealed O
normal O
potassium O
levels O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
p.r.n. O
verapamil O
and O
digoxin O
therapy O
for O
a O
heart O
rate O
varying O
between O
80 O
and O
110 O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
oxygen O
saturations O
continued O
to O
maintain O
at O
levels O
greater O
than O
95 O
percent O
and O
this O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
well O
controlled O
and O
she O
was O
placed O
on O
digoxin O
chronically O
and O
also O
diuresed O
for O
therapy O
. O

She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Surgical O
floor O
where O
on O
postoperative O
day O
three O
she O
began O
to O
complain O
of O
hypersensitivity O
in O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
and O
inability O
to O
move O
her O
toes O
. O

This O
was O
a O
new O
finding O
considering O
postoperatively O
she O
had O
full O
motor O
and O
sensory O
function O
of O
all O
four O
extremities O
. O

Neurologic O
assessment O
at O
the O
time O
did O
in O
fact O
reveal O
profound O
paresis O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
only O
with O
absent O
reflexes O
but O
hyperesthesia O
to O
light O
touch O
throughout O
the O
lower O
extremities O
. O

Laboratory O
data O
obtained O
revealed O
no O
significant O
changes O
from O
her O
initial O
postoperative O
levels O
. O

Neurological O
consultation O
was O
obtained O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
subjected O
significant O
cord O
ischemia O
and O
possibly O
this O
neurologic O
event O
also O
related O
to O
spinal O
or O
epidural O
catheter O
placement O
. O

The O
epidural O
catheter O
had O
been O
removed O
prior O
to O
their O
evaluation O
and O
no O
return O
of O
significant O
function O
was O
noted O
over O
the O
ensuing O
two O
days O
aside O
from O
flexion O
and O
extension O
of O
the O
toes O
but O
still O
the O
patient O
maintained O
profound O
proximal O
lower O
extremity O
weakness O
. O

MRI O
obtained O
did O
not O
reveal O
evidence O
of O
a O
structural O
cause O
for O
cord O
or O
root O
dysfunction O
and O
further O
recommendation O
of O
abdominal O
CT O
scanning O
in O
addition O
to O
EMGs O
and O
SSEPs O
to O
further O
evaluate O
and O
confirm O
the O
site O
of O
the O
lesion O
be O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
do O
well O
otherwise O
being O
slowly O
progressed O
in O
her O
diet O
and O
mobilized O
from O
bed O
to O
chair O
without O
difficulty O
. O

She O
was O
placed O
on O
a O
bowel O
regimen O
to O
alleviate O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
constipation O
while O
the O
workup O
to O
determine O
the O
exact O
etiology O
of O
her O
left O
lower O
extremity O
paresis O
could O
be O
identified O
. O

Continued O
supportive O
care O
was O
performed O
for O
the O
patient O
as O
again O
she O
manifested O
no O
other O
significant O
signs O
of O
hemodynamic O
or O
neurologic O
deterioration O
. O

Her O
ultimate O
diagnosis O
was O
subsequently O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
segmental O
infarction O
of O
the O
anterior O
and O
lateral O
part O
of O
her O
T10 O
level O
spinal O
cord O
and O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
that O
recovery O
of O
her O
left O
lower O
extremity O
would O
be O
obtained O
. O

Social O
Service O
consultation O
for O
rehabilitation O
placement O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
understands O
the O
ramifications O
of O
her O
disability O
and O
continued O
neurologic O
assessment O
is O
to O
be O
made O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
make O
slight O
gains O
in O
motor O
movement O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
as O
manifested O
by O
digital O
function O
and O
some O
knee O
jerk O

and O
by O
postoperative O
day O
eight O
she O
was O
manifesting O
some O
dorsiflexion O
in O
addition O
to O
urodynamics O
being O
performed O
revealed O
good O
detrusion O
contraction O
, O
normal O
sensation O
and O
a O
coordinated O
sphincter O
which O
suggested O
no O
disability O
to O
the O
sympathetic O
control O
of O
her O
bowel O
and O
bladder O
. O

The O
patient O
complained O
of O
some O
urinary O
incontinence O
and O
urgency O
on O
the O
10th O
postoperative O
day O
. O

She O
was O
placed O
on O
Bactrim O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
with O
a O
history O
of O
syncope O
for O
cardiac O
evaluation O
. O

She O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Cardiac O

Laboratory O
where O
a O
catheterization O
revealed O
an O
80% O

80% O
mid-LAD O
lesion O
and O
an O
LVEF O
of O
approximately O
80% O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
these O
lesions O
were O
unrelated O
to O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
episode O
, O
and O
were O
unlikely O
to O
cause O
her O
significant O
distress O
. O

On O

, O
she O
was O
taken O
to O
electrophysiologic O

During O
the O
study O
, O
the O

was O
hit O

, O
inducing O
a O
right O

. O

Following O
this O
, O
upon O
rapid O
atrial O
pacing O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
120 O
, O
there O
was O
revealed O
a O
bifascicular O
left O
block O
, O
which O
combined O
with O
the O
right O
bundle O
branch O
block O
caused O
a O
complete O
heart O
block O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
given O
this O
rate-related O
block O
on O
the O
left O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
physiologic O
malfunction O

the O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
workup O
of O
a O
presumed O
obstructive O
process O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Gastroenterology O
service O
and O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
an O
esophagogastroduodenoscopy O
would O
be O
performed O
. O

Prior O
to O
this O
study O
, O
however O
, O
a O
CT O
examination O
of O
the O
abdomen O
was O
obtained O
which O
showed O
a O
mass O
in O
the O
porta O
causing O
biliary O
ductal O
dilatation O
proximally O
and O
gastric O
outlet O
obstruction O
. O

On O
05/05 B-DATE
an O
esophagogastroduodenoscopy O
was O
performed O
, O
which O
showed O
gastric O
outlet O
obstruction O
, O
a O
deformed O
pylorus O
and O
a O
duodenal O
mass O
encasing O
and O
obstructing O
the O
lumen O
. O

It O
appeared O
that O
there O
was O
a O
large O
tumor O
mass O
obstructing O
the O
duodenum O
and O
pylorus O
area O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
a O
gastrojejunostomy O
for O
drainage O
of O
her O
stomach O
. O

The O
General O
Surgery O
service O
was O
involved O
at O
this O
stage O
, O
and O
on O
05/08 B-DATE
a O
posterior O
gastrojejunostomy O
with O
wedge O
liver O
biopsy O
was O
performed O
to O
facilitate O
gastric O
drainage O
. O

Pathology O
of O
the O
liver O
biopsy O
revealed O
metastatic O
, O
moderately O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma O
. O

The O
patient O
did O
well O
postoperatively O
and O
had O
prompt O
return O
of O
bowel O
function O
. O

However O
, O
on O
postoperative O
day O
#5 O
it O
was O
noticed O
that O
she O
had O
become O
acutely O
jaundiced O
, O
and O
her O
total O
bilirubin O
was O
found O
to O
be O
7.2 O
with O
a O
direct O
bilirubin O
of O
4.9 O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
she O
had O
now O
obstructed O
her O
biliary O
tree O
, O
as O
her O
urine O
became O
dark O
and O
her O
stools O
clay O
colored O
. O

After O
discussion O
with O
her O
family O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
a O
stent O
would O
not O
be O
placed O
for O
biliary O
decompression O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
confirmed O
as O
a O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
status O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
subsequent O
hospital O
course O
was O
fairly O
uneventful O
. O

She O
complained O
of O
fatigue O
but O
had O
a O
decent O
appetite O
. O

As O
she O
has O
an O
obstructing O
cancer O
of O
the O
biliary O
tree O
and O
further O
palliative O
procedures O
were O
deferred O
, O
her O
life O
expectancy O
is O
rather O
limited O
. O

The O
best O
course O
of O
action O
was O
placement O
in O
a O
nursing O
facility O
, O
as O
her O
family O
was O
unable O
to O
care O
for O
her O
at O
home O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Because O
of O
the O
severe O
headache O
, O
she O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Rashanemar B-DOCTOR
Block I-DOCTOR
and O
Dr. O
Riord B-DOCTOR
R. I-DOCTOR
Hall I-DOCTOR
. O

Dr. O
Rashanemar B-DOCTOR
Block I-DOCTOR
did O
a O
lumbar O
puncture O
which O
revealed O
an O
opening O
pressure O
of O
27 O
, O
and O
her O
cytologies O
came O
back O
positive O
for O
adenocarcinoma O
. O

She O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Pain O
Service O
who O
placed O
her O
on O
a O
posterior O
communicating O
artery O
pump O
which O
helped O
her O
dramatically O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
obtained O
both O
cranial O
and O
neck O
MR O
which O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
any O
enhancement O
or O
epidural O
abscess O
. O

When O
it O
was O
found O
that O
she O
had O
carcinomatous O
meningitis O
, O
she O
began O
interthecal O
methotrexate O
, O
given O
to O
her O
every O
three O
to O
four O
days O
by O
Dr. O
Hall B-DOCTOR
. O

This O
was O
well O
tolerated O
. O

Her O
cerebrospinal O
fluid O
pressure O
remained O
greater O
than O
35 O
cm O
of O
water O
for O
the O
first O
several O
days O
and O
because O
of O
this O
we O
decided O
to O
place O
an O
Ommaya O
reservoir O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Radiation O
Therapy O
who O
did O
not O
feel O
that O
radiation O
at O
this O
point O
would O
offer O
any O
advantages O
. O

She O
had O
a O
CSF O
flow O
study O
which O
showed O
normal O
flow O
CSF O
throughout O
her O
brain O
. O

She O
had O
multiple O
episodes O
of O
seizures O
during O
the O
hospitalization O
and O
required O
therapy O
with O
Tegretol O
. O

She O
was O
given O
some O
Mexiletine O
and O
Trazodone O
and O
did O
not O
tolerate O
that O
well O
. O

Once O
she O
was O
on O
good O
anti-seizure O
medicine O
, O
she O
calmed O
down O
very O
nicely O
in O
terms O
of O
not O
having O
any O
additional O
seizures O
. O

For O
the O
last O
several O
days O
of O
her O
hospitalization O
, O
we O
switched O
her O
over O
to O
a O
Duragesic O
patch O
and O
she O
actually O
took O
300 O
micrograms O
per O
hour O
of O
Duragesic O
and O
that O
seemed O
to O
make O
a O
big O
difference O
in O
terms O
of O
her O
pain O
control O
. O

Her O
headache O
came O
under O
very O
nice O
control O
with O
aggressive O
Duragesic O
patch O
. O

Access O
became O
a O
major O
problem O
and O
we O
had O
Dr. O
Anruchelle B-DOCTOR
Chaffchird I-DOCTOR
from O
Surgical O
Oncology O
place O
a O
double O
Port-a-cath O
without O
difficulty O
. O

The O
plan O
with O
Knutzxelljesc B-PATIENT
will O
be O
to O
follow O
her O
very O
carefully O
. O

She O
will O
be O
coming O
back O
to O
see O
us O
next O
Tuesday O
for O
infusion O
of O
her O
methotrexate O
. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

This O
twenty-six O
year O
old O
male O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Ph B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Of I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
on O
January B-DATE
26 I-DATE
, O
1994 O
to O
undergo O
surgical O
exploration O
of O
a O
conus O
tumor O
. O

He O
had O
previously O
been O
evaluated O
for O
back O
pain O
and O
found O
to O
have O
a O
conus O
tumor O
on O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Following O
the O
standard O
preoperative O
evaluation O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
and O
underwent O
a O
laminectomy O
T11 O
, O
T12 O
, O
and O
L1 O
and O
intradural O
microsurgical O
exploration O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
surgery O
we O
found O
an O
invasive O
conus O
tumor O
emanating O
from O
the O
ventral O
portio O
of O
the O
conus O
and O
completely O
engulfing O
and O
encircling O
all O
of O
the O
ventral O
nerve O
roots O
. O

The O
procedure O
had O
been O
done O
with O
intraoperative O
monitoring O
, O
and O
every O
time O
we O
made O
an O
attempt O
to O
dissect O
tumor O
away O
from O
the O
nerve O
roots O
we O
achieved O
considerable O
stimulation O
of O
the O
lower O
extremity O
muscles O
. O

We O
felt O
that O
the O
way O
the O
tumor O
was O
invading O
and O
wrapped O
around O
all O
of O
the O
nerves O
and O
sharing O
a O
common O
blood O
supply O
with O
them O
, O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
possible O
to O
achieve O
any O
form O
of O
significant O
surgical O
decompression O
or O
removal O
of O
tumor O
without O
leading O
to O
a O
substantial O
neurological O
deficit O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
operation O
was O
terminated O
by O
placing O
a O
large O
dural O
graft O
to O
provide O
intradural O
room O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
postoperatively O
the O
lesion O
would O
be O
treated O
with O
radiation O
therapy O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
. O

The O
postoperative O
course O
was O
without O
complication O
. O

Pain O
was O
managed O
initially O
with O
an O
intravenous O
patient O
controlled O
analgesia O
system O
. O

The O
wound O
healed O
without O
difficulty O
and O
the O
drain O
was O
removed O
. O

The O
patient O
began O
to O
ambulate O
. O

His O
leg O
strength O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
identical O
to O
the O
way O
it O
had O
been O
prior O
to O
the O
surgery O
. O

Because O
of O
his O
continued O
excellent O
progress O
, O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
be O
discharged O

pain O
at O
the O
site O
of O
a O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
done O
to O
evaluate O
a O
new O

. O

An O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scan O
showed O
a O
mass O
growing O
out O
of O
the O

x-ray O
showed O
multiple O
pulmonary O
nodules O
, O
which O
were O
thought O
, O
given O
the O
clinical O
situation O
, O
to O
be O
tumor O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
set O
to O
undergo O
radiation O
therapy O
to O
the O
mass O
in O
the O
right O
hip O
when O
he O
called O
complaining O

blood O
pressure O
. O

A O
few O
days O
prior O
to O

, O
he O
was O
also O
begun O
back O
on O
his O
prazosin O
and O
currently O
is O
at O
2 O
mg. O
PO O
QD O
. O

He O
was O
aggressively O
diuresed O

weight O
. O

His O
dobutamine O
was O
discontinued O
approximately O
2 O
days O
prior O
to O
discharge O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
have O
a O
good O
urine O
output O
to O
a O

would O
not O
decrease O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
. O

In O
consultation O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O

cells O
the O
day O
before O

for O
a O
hematocrit O
of O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

After O
admission O
, O
urology O
, O
nephrology O
as O
well O
as O
interventional O
radiology O
was O
consulted O
about O
the O
management O
of O
this O
patient O
. O

The O
specialist O
concluded O
that O
because O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hematuria O
seemed O
to O
be O
stable O
and O
hematocrit O
to O
maintain O
at O
about O
29-30 O
, O
there O
is O
no O
urgent O
need O
to O
do O
an O
arteriogram O
which O
may O
cause O
further O
damage O
to O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
kidney O
. O

Urology O
consultation O
thinks O
that O
cystoscopy O
would O
not O
add O
any O
benefit O
to O
the O
management O
and O
only O
would O
consider O
a O
right O
nephrostomy O
if O
renal O
function O
failed O
to O
improve O
. O

After O
admission O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
conservatively O
to O
correct O
his O
electrolyte O
and O
metabolic O
acidosis O
. O

He O
was O
given O
blood O
transfusion O
, O
two O
units O
when O
his O
hematocrit O
dropped O
to O
29.4 O
. O

After O
transfusion O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hematocrit O
rose O
to O
37.7 O
on O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
given O
sodium O
bicarbonate O
to O
correct O
his O
metabolic O
acidosis O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
pass O
about O
1500-2000 O
cc O
of O
urine O
a O
day O
and O
his O
renal O
function O
improved O
slowly O
with O
creatinine O
decreased O
to O
4.2 O
on O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
. O

During O
this O
admission O
, O
the O
patient O
also O
developed O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
ventricular O
rate O
of O
about O
70-80 O
. O

CPK O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
first O
hospital O
day O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
exam O
deteriorated O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
appeared O
to O
be O
blood O
pressure O
dependent O
. O

He O
had O
been O
started O
on O
Heparin O
from O
the O
time O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

A O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
had O
showed O
multiple O
lacunes O
, O
right O
greater O
than O

, O
and O
the O

was O
performed O
with O

, O
showing O
subcortical O
white O

and O
basal O

, O
but O
preserved O
middle O

. O

Because O
of O
his O
blood O
pressure O
, O
dependence O
of O
his O
left O
sided O
extremities O
, O
the O
lower O
leg O
specifically O
, O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
where O
he O
underwent O
hypertensive O
therapy O
for O
several O
days O
. O

His O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
goal O
was O
initially O
170-190 O
, O
which O
he O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
spontaneously O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
clear O
benefit O
at O
this O
level O
, O
and O
further O
deterioration O
in O
his O
left O
sided O
strength O
, O
this O
goal O
was O
increased O
and O
Neo-Synephrine O
was O
added O
to O
his O
regimen O
to O
achieve O
mean O
arterial O
pressures O
in O
the O
110-120 O
range O
. O

This O
strategy O
and O
its O
incumbent O
risks O
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
patient O
on O
Heparin O
, O
were O
discussed O
at O
length O
with O
both O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
family O
, O
who O
were O
very O
clear O
in O
wanting O
to O
proceed O
with O
all O
possible O
efforts O
to O
save O
the O
use O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
. O

While O
in O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
his O
strength O
deteriorated O
from O
being O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
left O
leg O
off O
the O
bed O
up O
to O
several O
inches O
to O
loosing O
virtually O
all O
distal O
extremity O
strength O
, O
and O
having O
a O
2-3/5 O
power O
in O
his O
proximal O
left O
leg O
groups O
. O

He O
also O
, O
as O
Neo-Synephrinewas O
tapered O
, O
developed O
mild O
sensory O
findings O
, O
in O
particular O
diminished O
large O
fiber O
sensibility O
in O
his O
left O
hand O
, O
although O
he O
at O
times O
, O
including O
near O
the O
end O
of O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
had O
a O
right O
gaze O
preference O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
exploring O
his O
visual O
space O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
look O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
elicit O
clear O
evidence O
for O
a O
field O
deficit O
. O

He O
was O
followed O
by O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
service O
, O
who O
assisted O
in O
the O
management O
of O
po O
intake O
which O
gradually O
improved O
, O
although O
he O
clearly O
had O
problems O
with O
manipulation O
of O
food O
in O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
would O
tend O
to O
accumulate O
a O
pouch O
of O
food O
in O
his O
left O
cheek O
. O

I O
should O
mention O
that O
his O
blood O
pressure O
therapy O
was O
at O
times O
limited O
by O
a O
severe O
headache O
, O
although O
he O
also O
had O
this O
off O
the O
pressor O
. O

He O
had O
several O
repeat O
imaging O
studies O
during O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
which O
showed O
further O
demarcation O
, O
but O
not O
extension O
of O
his O
prior O
infarct O
, O
both O
on O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
and O
DWI O
images O
. O

Additionally O
, O
he O
had O
a O
perfusion O
, O
diffusion O
MR O
study O
earlier O
on O
, O
which O
suggested O
the O
presence O
of O
viable O
penumbra O
, O
including O
the O
overlying O
cortex O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
regular O
neurology O
floor O
once O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
he O
was O
not O
receiving O
any O
significant O
benefit O
from O
hypertensive O
therapy O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
his O
neurologic O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
hemiplegia O
of O
his O
left O
arm O
, O
severe O
hemiparesis O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
, O
mild O
large O
fiber O
sensory O
loss O

intact O
mental O

, O
cranial O
nerve O
function O
, O
and O
right O

and O

. O

We O
anticipate O
that O
he O
represents O
a O
good O

RESUME O
OF O
HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
begun O
on O
intravenous O
hydration O
shortly O
after O
admission O
because O
of O
very O
poor O
PO O
fluid O
intake O
. O

Diagnostic O
work O
up O
included O
a O
fine O
needle O
aspiration O
of O
her O
right O
breast O
lesion O
which O
revealed O
ductal O
carcinoma O
, O
with O
estrogen O
and O
progesterone O
receptor O
status O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

She O
had O
a O
bone O
scan O
which O
showed O
multiple O
areas O
of O
increased O
uptake O
, O
particularly O
in O
L1 O
, O
L3 O
and O
L4 O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
left O
sixth O
posterior O
rib O
. O

This O
corresponded O
to O
a O
site O
of O
pain O
reported O
by O
the O
patient O
. O

Her O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
showed O
multiple O
lesions O
in O
the O
liver O
with O
enlarged O
periportal O
lymph O
nodes O
, O
cholelithiasis O
, O
and O
a O
left O
adrenal O
mass O
thought O
to O
likely O
represent O
metastatic O
disease O
. O

During O
her O
hospitalization O
, O
the O
main O
issues O
were O
pain O
control O
and O
nausea O
. O

Her O
pain O
was O
ultimately O
helped O
most O
by O
a O
regimen O
of O
oxycodone O
and O
oxycontin O
, O
and O
nausea O
responded O
to O
p.r.n. O
Trilafon O
. O

She O
was O
somewhat O
sedated O
on O
this O
regimen O
, O
and O
her O
standing O
Serax O
dose O
was O
reduced O
with O
substitution O
of O
Klonopin O
. O

She O
was O
seen O
by O
Radiation O
Medicine O
for O
palliative O
XRT O
to O
the O
painful O
lesions O
in O
her O
LS O
spine O
, O
and O
radiation O
therapy O
was O
begun O
on O
10/2 B-DATE
97 O
with O
the O
plan O
for O
approximately O
10 O
daily O
treatments O
. O

She O
required O
considerable O
encouragement O
to O
maintain O
PO O
intake O
, O
and O
required O
intravenous O
hydration O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
fluid O
intake O
during O
her O
hospitalization O
. O

A O
Physical O
Therapy O
evaluation O
could O
not O
be O
completed O
because O
of O
her O
degree O
of O
pain O
and O
nausea O
. O

She O
is O
being O
discharged O
to O
Linghs B-HOSPITAL
County I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
, O
with O
plans O
for O

availability O
which O
should O
be O
available O
within O
the O
coming O

She O
will O

Dr. O
Berca B-DOCTOR
Gachfrum I-DOCTOR
performed O
a O
right O
modified O
mastectomy O
and O
left O
simple O
mastectomy O
on O
November B-DATE
4 I-DATE
, O
1991 O
. O

The O
right O

cm O
poorly O
differentiated O
, O
Grade O
III O
out O
of O
III O
infiltrating O
ductal O
carcinoma O

The O
margins O
were O
free O
of O
tumor O
, O
but O
10 O
out O
of O
21 O
lymph O
nodes O
were O
positive O
for O
metastatic O
carcinoma O
. O

Furthermore O
there O
was O
a O
mass O
on O
the O
right O
pectoralis O
muscle O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
metastatic O

requiring O
surgical O
drainage O
. O

Therefore O
she O
had O
a O
Stage O
III-A O
adenocarcinoma O
of O
the O
breast O
. O

Since O
she O
was O
at O
high O

Although O
she O
had O
mediastinal O
recurrence O
, O
bone O
scan O
, O
head O
and O
liver O
CT O
were O
negative O
for O

In O
summary O
, O
the O
patient O
is O
a O
49 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
metastatic O
breast O
cell O
CA O
, O
status O
post O
chemotherapy O
with O
CMSAP O
and O
PVSC O
and O
XRT O
who O
presented O
with O
fever O
, O
four O
days O
of O
diarrhea O
, O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
had O
been O
on O
Keflex O
for O
an O
erythema O
on O
her O
left O
chest O
wall O
. O

The O
Keflex O
was O
stopped O
when O
she O
developed O
the O
diarrhea O
. O

When O
she O
arrived O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
treat O
here O
rythematous O
induration O
and O
possible O
cellulitis O
with O
IV O
antibiotics O
. O

So O
she O
was O
put O
on O
dicloxicillin O
and O
we O
did O
local O
wound O
care O
with O
an O
agent O
called O
Santyl O
, O
which O
is O
a O
collagenace O
ondebrided O
which O
worked O
very O
well O
for O
her O
. O

Also O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
we O
were O
also O
considering O
palliative O
Taxol O
chemotherapy O
, O
which O
the O
patient O
declined O
. O

She O
refused O
the O
Taxol O
therapy O
so O
that O
was O
not O
done O
. O

Another O
major O
issue O
with O
this O
patient O
was O
pain O
control O
. O

She O
had O
been O
in O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
pain O
from O
her O
left O
arm O
lesion O
. O

So O
pain O
control O
was O
a O
big O
issue O
so O
she O
was O
on O
MS O
Contin O
and O
MSIR O
at O
home O
she O
thought O
that O
clouded O
her O
thinking O
, O
so O
we O
tried O
different O
things O
for O
pain O
management O
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
to O
do O
a O
subarachnoid O
neurologic O
block O
at O
C6-C7 O
interface O
on O
1-6 B-DATE
94 O
. O

After O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
minimal O
relief O
of O
pain O
. O

However O
, O
she O
declined O
further O
blocks O
, O
which O
were O
offered O
to O
her O
. O

So O
accepted O
to O
be O
on O
dilaudid O
p.o. O
which O
was O
started O
at O
a O
dosage O
of O
2-4 O
meg O
but O
since O
then O
we O
have O
tapered O
it O
up O
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
dilaudid O
8 O
mg O
q2h O
and O
in O
addition O
she O
has O
been O
on O
fentanyl O
patch O
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
75 O
micrograms O
per O
hour O
of O
the O
fentanyl O
patch O
which O
is O
changed O
every O
72 O
hours O
. O

We O
can O
go O
up O
by O
25 O
mg O
on O
the O
fentanyl O
patch O
as O
needed O
to O
control O
her O
pain O
and O
we O
can O
always O
go O
up O
on O
the O
dilaudid O
because O
she O
is O
still O
in O
considerable O
amount O
of O
pain O
. O

Other O
things O
that O
happened O
during O
this O
admission O
- O
we O
obtained O
ahead O
CT O
for O
her O
on O
the O
8th B-DATE
of I-DATE
January I-DATE
because O
of O
her O
clouded O
thinking O
and O
altered O
mental O
status O
, O
which O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
morphine O
that O
she O
was O
taking O
. O

We O
went O
ahead O
and O
got O
a O
head O
CT O
scanand O
it O
showed O
no O
enhancing O
lesions O
. O

In O
addition O
her O
liver O
transaminases O
were O
elevated O
, O
we O
thought O
about O
doing O
further O
work-up O
, O
but O
that O
was O
deferred O
because O
the O
patient O
wanted O
to O
wait O
on O
that O
. O

That O
has O
been O
stable O
. O

The O
patient O
on O
January B-DATE
13 I-DATE
became O
hyponatremic O
. O

Her O
sodium O
went O
down O
to O
121 O
and O
before O
that O
on O
admission O
she O
was O
133 O
. O

A O
renal O
consult O
was O
obtained O
and O
their O
assessment O
was O
that O
this O
was O
probably O
a O
mixture O
of O
hypovolemia O
as O
well O
as O
SIADH O
. O

We O
proceeded O
to O
do O
for O
her O
hyponatremia O
- O
we O
gave O
her O
some O
fluid O
and O
her O
urine O
sodium O
became O
higher O
than O
her O
serum O
sodium O
; O
we O
stopped O
it O
. O

We O
had O
given O
her O
some O
normal O
saline O
and O
then O
we O
proceeded O
to O
just O
do O
fluid O
restriction O
. O

In O
addition O
we O
gave O
her O
a O
sodium O
chloride O
one O
gram O
per O
day O
and O
that O
also O
helped O
, O
so O
that O
now O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
sodium O
is O
between O
126 O
and O
129 O
; O
prior O
to O
that O
it O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
as O
low O
116. O

So O
that O
has O
really O
improved O
. O

We O
suggest O
continuing O
increased O
salt O
intake O
in O
her O
diet O
and O
also O
continuing O
with O
the O
fluid O
restriction O
of O
free O
water O
intake O
to O
one O
liter O
per O
day O
. O

On O
the O
14th B-DATE
of I-DATE
January I-DATE
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
increased O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
taken O
showed O
a O
wedge O
shaped O
infiltrate O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
lobe O
which O
was O
consistent O
with O
Hampton O
&apos;s O
hump O
. O

Also O
a O
VQ O
scan O
obtained O
the O
next O
day O
showed O
high O
probability O
for O
PE O
. O

So O
we O
proceeded O
to O
put O
her O
on O
heparin O
for O
anticoagulation O
and O
then O
when O
she O
was O
therapeutic O
on O
heparin O
, O
we O
went O
ahead O
and O
started O
her O
on O
coumadin O
and O
she O
is O
currently O
on O
coumadin O
at O
2.5 O
mg O
q.h.s. O

Her O
INR O
is O
2.3 O
. O

We O
want O
her O
INR O
to O
remain O
between O
2 O
and O
3 O
. O

So O
if O
it O
goes O
much O
lower O
than O
2 O
, O
then O
we O
would O
consider O
increasing O
it O
to O
perhaps O
coumadin O
2.5 O
and O
5 O
alternating O
every O
other O
night O
. O

However O
, O
we O
would O
leave O
it O
at O
2.5 O
for O
now O
. O

Other O
major O
issues O
- O
As O
a O
result O
of O
all O
the O
things O
happened O
and O
with O
her O
hyponatremia O
and O
also O
the O
other O
problems O
, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
was O
elevated O
also O
. O

We O
put O
her O
on O
nifedipine O
IR O
, O
SL O
and O
that O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
control O
her O
blood O
pressure O
which O
was O
in O
the O
200s O
in O
the O
systolic O
, O
so O
we O
had O
started O
her O
on O
atenolol O
. O

So O
on O
discharge O
she O
is O
on O
atenolol O
100 O
. O

If O
needed O
to O
you O
can O
give O
her O
some O
nifedipine O
SL O
to O
decrease O
her O
blood O
pressure O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
has O
significant O
edema O
in O
both O
arms O
now O
and O
also O
some O
mild O
edema O
in O
the O
lower O
extremities O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
fluid O
restriction O
should O
help O
with O
that O
. O

She O
is O
also O
a O
little O
dry O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
on O
oxygen O
. O

Ever O
since O
the O
pulmonary O
embolus O
she O
has O
been O
on O
oxygen O
. O

She O
was O
on O
4 O
liters O
; O
now O
she O
is O
on O
5 O
liters O
, O
sating O
94 O
to O
96% O
on O
5 O
liters O
. O

We O
would O
like O
for O
her O
to O
remain O
on O
the O
oxygen O
as O
well O
. O

The O
complications O
that O
I O
have O
listed O
include O
the O
hyponatremia O
, O
pulmonary O
embolus O
and O
also O
the O
elevatd O
blood O
pressure O

After O

A O

showed O
clearing O
of O
the O
opacities O
in O
the O
chest O
x-ray O
that O
were O
consistent O
with O
pulmonary O
edema O
because O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
some O
abnormality O
in O
the O
right O

. O

The O

it O
was O
felt O
that O

The O

but O
towards O
the O
last O
2-3 O
days O
of O
his O

the O
amount O
of O
improvement O
was O
minimal O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
respiratory O

has O
been O
maximally O
treated O
by O
then O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
major O
improvement O
came O
after O
the O
first O
two O

with O
brisk O
diuresis O
with O

. O

While O
in O
the O
Oaksgekesser/ B-HOSPITAL
Memorial I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
the O
patient O
on O
4/4 B-DATE
99 O
complained O
of O
mild O
epigastric O
discomfort O
because O
he O
was O
put O
in O
Cimetidine O
while O
in O
the O
Intensive O

did O
have O
any O
nausea O
, O

or O
evidence O
of O
gastrointestinal O
bleeding O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O

over O
the O
next O

or O
so O
in O

While O

Hospital I-HOSPITAL
the O
patient O
was O
never O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O

. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
when O

with O
physical O
therapy O

Discussion O
with O
the O
family O
regarding O
the O
possibility O
of O
sending O
him O
to O

was O
entertained O
however O
the O
family O
strongly O
refused O
to O
allow O
him O
to O

They O
wanted O
the O

to O
return O

CONDITION O

: O

The O

be O
expected O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
severe O
chronic O
obstructive O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

This O
is O
a O
64 O
year O
old O
patient O
initially O
admitted O
to O
Dr. O
Riode B-DOCTOR
Area I-DOCTOR
status O
post O
an O
aorto O
bifemoral O
bypass O
in O
01 B-DATE
98 O
with O
an O
end O
to O
end O
proximal O
and O
to O
the O
common O
femoral O
bilaterally O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
recurrent O
claudication O
for O
the O
last O
five O
months O
and O
has O
developed O
lesions O
on O
the O
first O
toe O
which O
is O
apparently O
similar O
to O
aparonychia O
. O

He O
had O
an O
angiogram O
which O
shows O
a O
severe O
stenosis O
in O
the O
right O
distal O
area O
with O
a O
thrombosing O
right O
limb O
of O
an O
aorto O
femoral O
graft O
. O

He O
also O
has O
an O
irregular O
lesion O
at O
the O
profunda O
femoris O
origin O
and O
with O
the O
superficial O
femoral O
occluded O
bilaterally O
. O

He O
was O
therefore O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
an O
ileofemoral O
bypass O
. O

The O
patient O
unfortunately O
continues O
to O
smoke O
and O
has O
greater O
than O
a O
50 O
pack O
year O
history O
of O
smoking O
and O
by O
notes O
of O
Dr. O
Area B-DOCTOR
&apos;s O
office O
, O
this O
has O
been O
discussed O
at O
length O
with O
him O
and O
the O
implications O
of O
the O
smoking O
. O

He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
a O
deep O
vein O
thrombosis O
and O
a O
question O
of O
a O
pulmonary O
embolism O
with O
what O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
non O
fully O
documented O
hypercoagulable O
state O
. O

He O
had O
a O
left O
superficial O
femoral O
artery O
interposition O
graft O
around O
1990 O
which O
is O
non O
functioning O
at O
the O
present O
time O
, O
most O
of O
which O
was O
done O
at O
the O
Alconspore B-HOSPITAL
Woocawo I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

ALLERGIES O
: O

The O
patient O
has O
no O
known O
drug O
allergies O
. O

MEDICATIONS O
ON O
ADMISSION O
: O

His O
medications O
on O
admission O
include O
Coumadin O
and O
Levofloxacin O
. O

His O
Coumadin O
has O
been O
held O
for O
two O
days O
. O

His O
claudication O
is O
equal O
bilaterally O
. O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION O
: O

On O
physical O
examination O
was O
remarkable O
for O
no O
carotid O
bruits O
, O
a O
ventral O
hernia O
without O
any O
masses O
which O
was O
reasonably O
reducible O
. O

His O
rectal O
exam O
was O
refused O
at O
the O
time O
of O
surgery O
since O
apparently O
it O
was O
negative O
at O
the O
Tocon B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
the O
previous O
week O
. O

He O
has O
a O
first O
and O
fourth O
toe O
which O
had O
some O
purulent O
discharge O
around O
the O
toes O
with O
ischemic O
modeled O
toes O
and O
on O
the O
left O
side O
there O
were O
no O
lesions O
in O
the O
feet O
. O

His O
pulse O
exam O
was O
a O
femoral O
pulse O
bilaterally O
, O
but O
none O
distally O
. O

LABORATORY O
DATA O
: O

His O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
were O
within O
normal O
limits O
at O
16 O
and O
1.3 O
and O
his O
hematocrit O
was O
44 O
with O
a O
white O
blood O
count O
of O
10,000 O
and O
139,000 O
platelet O
count O
. O

He O
has O
ankle O
brachial O
indices O
of O
.36 O
bilaterally O
but O
with O
his O
right O
toes O
appearing O
ischemic O
with O
lesions O
he O
would O
most O
likely O
not O
heal O
these O
lesions O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Dr. O
Area B-DOCTOR
had O
asked O
me O
to O
see O
the O
patient O
and O
after O
discussing O
with O
the O
patient O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
I O
would O
proceed O
with O
revascularization O
of O
his O
right O
leg O
since O
he O
had O
a O
angiogram O
which O
demonstrated O
a O
failing O
limb O
of O
his O
aortofemoral O
graft O
and O
a O
tight O
profundus O
stenosis O
. O

After O
discussing O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
getting O
his O
prothrombin O
time O
closer O
to O
range O
, O
he O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
where O
a O
ileo O
profunda O
bypass O
was O
performed O
with O
an O
8 O
mm O
. O

EP O
to O
FE O
under O
general O
endotracheal O
anesthesia O
. O

There O
was O
copious O
thrombus O
in O
the O
distal O
right O
limb O
of O
the O
aortofemoral O
graft O
which O
also O
had O
a O
thromboendarterectomy O
performed O
and O
excellent O
inflow O
was O
achieved O
. O

Superficial O
femoral O
artery O
was O
divided O
since O
it O
was O
also O
chronically O
occluded O
. O

There O
was O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
thrombus O
at O
the O
anastomosis O
as O
well O
which O
had O
developed O
a O
small O
aneurysmaltype O
of O
dilatation O
, O
although O
there O
was O
no O
dehiscence O
of O
the O
anastomosis O
. O

The O
profunda O
had O
been O
opened O
beyond O
the O
origin O
stenosis O
and O
the O
bypass O
was O
then O
performed O
providing O
and O
excellent O
flow O
to O
the O
calf O
and O
excellent O
pulsevolume O
recordings O
were O
obtained O
with O
strong O
upstrokes O
. O

It O
was O
therefore O
elected O
not O
to O
proceed O
with O
a O
distal O
bypass O
graft O
to O
the O
popliteal O
arteries O
which O
would O
have O
been O
required O
should O
this O
not O
have O
worked O
. O

The O
patient O
postoperatively O
did O
quite O
well O
. O

He O
had O
continued O
good O
post O
volume O
recordings O
and O
there O
was O
no O
question O
that O
with O
this O
improved O
circulation O
and O
Silvadene O
dressings O
to O
his O
toes O
that O
they O
actually O
started O
to O
heal O
in O
his O
postoperative O
course O
with O
improved O
perfusion O
and O
capillary O
refill O
. O

His O
groin O
incision O
was O
healing O
nicely O
and O
he O
was O
on O
Heparin O
, O
being O
converted O
to O
Coumadin O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
issue O
relating O
to O
his O
hypercoagulable O
state O
, O
and O
the O
need O
for O
getting O
him O
in O
range O
, O
he O
was O
keptin O
the O
hospital O
and O
not O
discharged O
. O

The O
orders O
of O
his O
wounds O
and O
wound O
care O
were O
clarified O
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
Frontera B-HOSPITAL
34 I-HOSPITAL
to O
ensure O
that O
this O
would O
be O
performed O
properly O
. O

No O
cellulitis O
was O
present O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
indicated O
his O
desire O
to O
be O
discharged O
. O

Despite O
loading O
him O
on O
Coumadin O
, O
his O
prothrombin O
time O
and O
INR O
increased O
slowly O
and O
he O
left O
the O
hospital O
without O
discharge O
order O
or O
discharge O
planning O
on O
the O
18th B-DATE
of I-DATE
December I-DATE
. O

I O
had O
called O
the O
patient O
and O
discussed O
with O
him O
his O
care O
, O
which O
he O
had O
been O
then O
transferring O
to O
his O
local O
medical O
doctor O
for O
anticoagulation O
purposes O
. O

I O
explained O
to O
the O
patient O
that O
because O
of O
his O
early O
discharge O
I O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
his O
care O
but O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
see O
him O
in O
theoffice O
for O
removal O
of O
his O
sutures O
and O
an O
appointment O
for O
that O
was O
undertaken O
. O

EDG O
was O
performed O
which O
showed O
several O
smaller O
esophageal O
varices O
with O
two O
larger O
varices O
at O
the O
gastroesophageal O
junction O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
gastric O
varices O
. O

These O
two O
varices O
were O
banded O
without O
difficulty O
. O

Postoperatively O
the O
patient O
did O
quite O
well O
, O
he O
was O
kept O
NPO O
for O
24 O
hours O
and O

gradually O
started O
on O
clear O
liquids O
. O

He O
is O
tolerating O
a O
soft O
solid O

The O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
fairly O
hypotensive O
throughout O
his O
hospitalization O
despite O
aggressive O
fluid O
resuscitation O
. O

This O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
secondary O
to O
his O
Inderal O
dose O
. O

Subsequently O
his O
beta O

dose O
was O
decreased O
to O
5 O
mg O

of O
4.8 O
. O

He O
is O
continued O
on O
his O
Ofloxacin O

has O
a O
small O
pleural O
effusion O
, O
he O
does O
not O
have O
any O
evidence O
of O
ascites O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O
patient O
continues O
to O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
possible O
liver O
transplant O
and O
his O
evaluation O
for O
placement O
on O
the O
transplant O
list O
is O
still O
in O
progress O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
awaiting O
a O
final O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Oaksgekesser/ B-HOSPITAL
Memorial I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
on O
7-28 B-DATE
94 O
for O
placement O
of O
an O
infusaid O
pump O
versus O
an O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
for O
liver O
resection O
. O

Prior O
to O
surgery O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
Vascular O
Radiology O
where O
she O
underwent O
superior O
mesenteric O
artery O
and O
ciliac O
angiograms O
. O

These O
demonstrated O

1. O
portal O
vein O
patent O
, O

2. O
normal O
hepaticanatomy O
with O
normal O
right O
and O
left O
hepatic O
arteries O
, O

3. O
an O
enlarged O
liver O
with O
necrotic O
regions O
consistent O
with O
known O
colon O
metastatic O
tumors O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
subsequently O
brought O
to O
the O
Operating O
Room O
where O
she O
underwent O
a O
hepatic O
right O
trisegmentectomy O
. O

The O
operative O
findings O
were O
notable O
for O
a O
softball O
sized O
tumor O
in O
the O
right O
lobe O
of O
the O
liver O
, O
as O
well O
as O
multiple O
smaller O
tumor O
nodules O
. O

The O
left O
lateral O
segment O
was O
grossly O
free O
of O
tumor O
. O

The O
intraoperative O
course O
was O
notable O
for O
acute O
hypotension O
with O
a O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
fifties O
. O

The O
patient O
received O
21 O
liters O
of O
lactated O
Ringers O
solution O
, O
16 O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
, O
and O
21 O
units O
of O
fresh O
frozen O
plasma O
, O
and O
12 O
units O
of O
platelets O
. O

There O
were O
5300 O
cc O
given O
via O
the O
Cellsaver O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

However O
, O
over O
the O
ensuing O
hours O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
have O
ongoing O
blood O
loss O
with O
hypotension O
. O

The O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
return O
the O
patient O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
returned O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
for O
an O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
for O
bleeding O
. O

The O
operative O
findings O
were O
notable O
for O
bleeding O
from O
the O
inferior O
vena O
cava O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
returned O
again O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

However O
, O
again O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
demonstrate O
ongoing O
hypotension O
and O
transfusion O
requirements O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
blood O
pressure O
support O
with O
pressors O
. O

Due O
to O
output O
of O
approximately O
950 O
cc O
on O
placement O
of O
a O
right O
chest O
tube O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
return O
tothe O
operating O
room O
for O
exploration O
for O
bleeding O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
therefore O
explored O
through O
a O
right O
thoracoabdominal O
incision O
. O

The O
abdomen O
was O
again O
notable O
for O
bleeding O
from O
the O
inferior O
vena O
cava O
, O
a O
notable O
coagulopathy O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
the O
abdomen O
was O
packed O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

However O
, O
over O
the O
subsequent O
8-10 O
hours O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
demonstrate O
declining O
blood O
pressure O
despite O
maximal O
support O
with O
pressor O
agents O
including O
phenylephrine O
, O
norepinephrine O
, O
epinephrine O
, O
and O
dopamine O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
require O
transfusions O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
oxygenation O
became O
increasingly O
difficult O
, O
as O
the O
chest O
X-rays O
demonstrated O
marked O
pulmonary O
edema O
. O

The O
ventilator O
settings O
demonstrated O
elevating O
peak O
inspiratory O
pressures O
up O
to O
75 O
millimeters O
. O

The O
urine O
output O
dropped O
dramatically O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
Lasix O
and O
Mannitol O
for O
an O
attempt O
at O
forced O
diuresis O
. O

As O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hemodynamic O
parameters O
demonstrated O
a O
narrow O
pulse O
pressure O
and O
rapidly O
elevated O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressures O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
perform O
echocardiogram O
to O
rule O
out O
potential O
paracardial O
tamponade O
. O

The O
study O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
inadequate O
, O
and O
it O
was O
unable O
definitively O
rule O
out O
the O
presence O
of O
such O
tamponade O
. O

Despite O
maximal O
support O
with O
pressor O
agents O
, O
mechanical O
ventilation O
, O
and O
ongoing O
transfusion O
with O
fresh O
frozen O

, O
and O
a O
Protamine O
for O
treatment O
of O
the O
coagulopathy O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
demonstrate O
declining O
blood O
pressure O
, O
and O
subsequently O
expired O

who O
recommended O
that O
, O
if O
she O
were O
to O
undergo O
an O
operative O
procedure O
, O
that O
she O
first O
have O
a O
coronary O
perfusion O

. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Breutz B-DOCTOR
of O
the O
GI O
Service O
who O
assessed O
her O
as O
not O
needing O
colonoscopy O
or O
a O
GI O
series O
at O
this O
time O
. O

She O
was O
also O
seen O
by O
the O
Stroke O
Service O
who O
noted O
that O
a O
recent O
magnetic O
resonance O
angiogram O
had O
reportedly O
shown O
a O
right O
common O
carotid O
artery O
occlusion O
. O

They O
also O
noted O
that O
a O
careful O
elicitation O
of O
her O
visual O
symptoms O
seemed O
possibly O
consistent O
more O
with O
migraine O
than O
with O
ischemia O
. O

They O
recommended O
that O
she O
have O
a O
baseline O
head O
computerized O
tomographyscan O
, O
agreed O
with O
obtaining O
an O
angiogram O
and O
recommended O
trying O
a O
trial O
of O
migraine O
therapy O
to O
see O
if O
ocular O
symptoms O
resolved O
. O

Meanwhile O
the O
patient O
was O
heparinized O

showed O
: O

2. O
an O
occluded O
right O
common O

and O
reconstitution O
of O
a O
short O
segment O
of O
right O

Given O
these O
angiographic O
findings O
, O
which O
were O
not O
amenable O
to O
surgery O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
weaned O

In O
retrospect O
, O
her O
symptoms O
may O
have O
been O
surrounding O
the O
final O
thrombosis O
of O
her O
right O
carotid O
. O

A O
perfusion O
scan O
was O
not O
necessary O
as O
no O

procedure O
was O
entertained O
. O

An O
I-head O
computerized O

done O
on O
11/16 B-DATE

showed O
two O
areas O
of O

to O
his O
cancer O
. O

He O
underwent O
abdominal O
paracentesis O
approximately O
two O
times O
a O
week O
for O
therapeutic O
. O

This O
had O
to O
be O
performed O
by O
IR O
because O
the O
pocket O
was O
too O
deep O
to O
access O
from O
the O
bedside O
. O

He O
received O
a O
two O
week O
course O
of O
broad O
spectrum O
antibiotics O
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin O
IV O
for O
prophylaxis O
against O
SBP O
. O

2. O
Pulmonary O
. O

From O
a O
pulmonary O
standpoint O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
complain O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
. O

His O
apical O
pneumothorax O
from O
the O
outside O
hospital O
had O
resolved O
. O

Chest O
xray O
was O
consistent O
with O
pleurodesis O
. O

However O
, O
with O
persistent O
abdomen O
distention O
, O
there O
is O
likely O
restrictive O
deficit O
and O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
after O
each O
tap O
, O
he O
at O
times O
became O
hypotensive O
and O
with O
some O
mild O
fluid O
resuscitation O
decompensated O
with O
pulmonary O
edema O
, O
requiring O
both O
albumin O
and O
Lasix O
to O
try O
to O
mobilize O
third O
space O
fluids O
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
, O
he O
is O
stating O
approximately O
91 O
to O
92% O
on O
three O
to O
four O
liters O
. O

Chest O
xray O
is O
still O
consistent O
with O
volume O
overload O
. O

The O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
continue O
to O
try O
to O
alternate O
albumin O
and O
Lasix O
to O
mobilize O
his O
fluid O
. O

3. O
Cardiovascular O
. O

He O
had O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia O
without O
subsequent O
fall O
in O
blood O
pressure O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

He O
was O
ruled O
out O
for O
a O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

Echocardiogram O
showed O
50% O
ejection O
fraction O
with O
mild O
mitral O
regurgitation O
. O

He O
did O
not O
show O
any O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia O
throughout O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
hospital O
course O
. O

4. O
Endocrine O

. O

His O
Avandia O
was O
discontinued O

He O
is O
being O
maintained O
on O
glipizide O
and O
sliding O
scale O
insulin O
. O

5. O
Heme O
. O

From O
a O
heme O
standpoint O
, O
he O
presented O
anemic O
and O
with O
an O
elevated O
PT O
INR O
. O

He O
required O
a O
few O
transfusions O
during O
his O
hospital O
course O
. O

He O
also O
required O
FFP O
initially O
to O
reverse O
his O
coagulopathy O
. O

However O
, O
this O
resolved O
on O
its O
own O
over O
the O
hospital O
course O
. O

His O
INR O
normalized O
, O
however O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
he O
developed O
bilateral O
deep O
venous O
thromboses O
during O
his O
hospital O
course O
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Lovenox O
. O

6. O
Renal O
. O

He O
had O
a O
creatinine O
of O
4.0 O
on O
admission O
and O
this O
decreased O
down O
to O
the O
mid O
ones O
with O
fluid O
, O
currently O
at O
1.7 O
on O
discharge O
. O

From O
his O
urinalysis O
, O
he O
has O
mostly O
a O
prerenal O
state O
. O

However O
, O
he O
does O
require O
diuresis O
to O
prevent O
increased O
volume O
overload O
in O
his O
lungs O
from O
his O
hypoalbunemic O
state O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
Nutrition O
was O
following O
, O
initially O
with O
a O
low O
fat O
, O
low O
cholesterol O
, O
low O
sugar O
diet O
. O

His O
appetite O
is O
decreasing O
somewhat O
as O
his O
disease O
process O
progresses O
, O
therefore O
, O
we O
have O
liberalized O
his O
diet O
for O
him O
to O
take O
what O
he O
wishes O
. O

7. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
broad O
spectrum O
antibiotics O
for O
a O
14 O

for O
clinical O
SBP O
. O

He O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin O

Oncology O

The O
patient O
initially O
came O
for O
workup O
of O
pancreatic O
cancer O
with O
a O
questions O
of O
palliative O
chemotherapy O
. O

However O
, O
given O
his O
rapid O
clinical O
decline O
, O
this O
was O
deferred O
and O
I O
do O
not O
suspect O
that O
he O
will O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O
, O
as O
the O
degree O
of O
his O
decline O
bodes O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
him O
. O

His O
pain O
here O
has O
been O
controlled O
, O
initially O
on O
Oxycontin O
with O
morphine O
for O
breakthrough O
pain O
. O

As O
he O
becomes O
progressively O
more O
somnolent O
, O
this O
will O
likely O
need O
to O
be O
switched O
to O
IV O

at O

should O
occur O
with O
the O

about O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

Our O
impression O
was O
this O
was O
a O
73 O
year O
old O
man O
with O

hypertension O
, O
hepatocellular O
carcinoma O

without O
acid O
blockade O
who O
presented O
with O
an O
upper O
GI O
bleed O
with O
multiple O
esophageal O
and O
gastric O
varices O
. O

His O
portal O
hypertension O
resulting O
in O
a O
ruptured O
varices O
was O
almost O
certainly O
his O
cause O
of O
bleed O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
ulcers O
on O
endoscopy O
. O

His O
bleed O
also O
might O
have O
been O
precipitated O
by O
med O
non-compliance O
versus O
other O
causes O
of O
increased O
blood O
pressure O
such O
as O
increased O
salt O
intake O
. O

The O
temporal O
proximity O
to O
paracentesis O
was O
initially O
worrisome O
for O
an O
underlying O
infection O
without O
precipitating O
hemodynamic O
imbalance O
, O
although O
no O
evidence O
of O
infection O
was O
established O
with O
any O
sputum O

paracentesis O
culture O
or O
blood O
culture O

Given O
the O
extent O

, O
the O
risk O
of O
worsening O
obstruction O
to O
portal O

versus O

was O
also O
increased O

, O
he O
was O
in O

Pulmonary O
wise O
, O
he O
had O
some O
wheezing O
on O

He O
was O
treated O
with O

There O
was O
a O

GI O
wise O
, O
he O
underwent O

esophageal O
varices O
. O

He O
was O
kept O
NPO O
. O

He O
was O
started O
originally O
on O
propranolol O
and O
then O
switched O
to O
metoprolol O
as O
he O
experienced O
some O
wheezing O
in O
order O
to O
decrease O
his O
portal O
pressure O
. O

He O
was O
also O
started O
on O
triatide O
, O
omeprazole O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
Hem O
wise O
, O
he O
had O
experienced O
an O
approximately O
12 O
point O
crit O

with O
this O

. O

For O
this O
, O
he O
was O
given O
6 O

4 O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O

He O
was O
also O
given O
Vitamin O

He O
was O
treated O
with O

. O

He O
was O
kept O
in O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
24 O
hours O
during O
which O
time O
, O
his O
hematocrit O
remained O
stable O
and O
he O
had O
no O
other O
signs O
of O
continued O
GI O
bleed O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
Carespistown B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
for O
further O
management O
. O

On O
his O
second O
day O
of O
admission O
, O
there O
was O
a O
concern O
about O
a O
developing O
pneumonia O
based O
on O
a O
worsening O
lung O
exam O
and O
also O
worsening O
cough O
, O
although O
sputum O
and O
all O
blood O
cultures O
remained O
negative O
for O
pathogens O
and O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
have O
a O
temperature O
spike O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
he O
was O
started O
on O
Levoflox O
250 O
mg. O
PO O
QD O
on O
March B-DATE
18th I-DATE
as O
well O
as O
Flagyl O
500 O
mg. O
IV O
TID O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
an O
emerging O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
. O

The O
major O
therapeutic O
concern O
on O
the O
floor O
was O
diuresis O
. O

His O
Aldactone O
was O
gradually O
titrated O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
dose O
of O
400 O
mg. O
per O
day O
divided O
in O
three O
even O
doses O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Lasix O
was O
added O
on O
to O
help O
him O
with O
diuresis O
. O

Between O
March B-DATE
20th I-DATE
and O
March B-DATE
25th I-DATE
, O
he O
lost O
approximately O
7 O
pounds O
on O
this O
regimen O
. O

However O
, O
after O
Lasix O
was O
added O
back O
on O
, O
his O
creatinine O
rose O
from O
approximately O
1.4 O
up O
to O
1.7 O
and O
Lasix O
was O
held O
for O
24 O
hours O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
a O
dose O
of O
20 O
mg. O
IV O
BID O
was O
re-instigated O
. O

On O
the O
400 O
mg. O
of O
Aldactone O
, O
his O
potassium O
remained O
in O
the O
high O
normal O
range O
around O
5.0 O
. O

Therefore O
, O
on O
March B-DATE
25th I-DATE
, O
his O
Aldactone O
was O
decreased O
to O
100 O
mg. O
PO O
TID O
and O
Lasix O
was O
kept O
at O
20 O
mg. O
BID O
. O

On O
this O
regimen O
, O
his O
weight O
remained O
approximately O
stable O
. O

He O
was O
also O
kept O
on O
a O
low O
salt O

ADDENDUM O
: O

Unfortunately O
patient O
could O
not O
be O
discharged O
on O
3/28 B-DATE
98 O
because O
, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
starting O
his O
Lasix O
, O
his O
creatinine O
bumped O
overnight O
from O
1.7 O
to O
2.2 O
, O
possibly O
because O
of O
a O
progression O
of O
his O
hepatorenal O
syndrome O
. O

His O
potassium O
also O
climbed O
to O
5.1 O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
we O
held O
all O
of O
his O
diuretics O
, O
namely O
his O
Lasix O
and O
Aldactone O
. O

Despite O
holding O
his O
Aldactone O
, O
his O
potassium O
continued O
to O
rise O
over O
the O

of O
the O
next O
two O

It O
went O
as O
high O
as O

He O
was O

this O
. O

By O

his O

On O

the O
junior O

, O
Dr. O

, O
had O
an O
extensive O
conversation O
with O
the O
patient O
about O
his O
future O
medical O
care O
. O

Patient O
was O
very O
clear O
that O
he O
did O
not O
want O
any O
extraordinary O
measures O
done O
in O
case O
of O
acute O
illness O
. O

Specifically O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
intubated O
or O
have O
any O
of O
the O
ACLS O
protocol O
in O
the O
case O
of O
acardiac O
or O
pulmonary O

. O

He O
also O
was O
very O
adamant O
that O
if O
he O
was O
to O
rapidly O
GI O
bleed O
, O
as O
from O
an O
esophageal O
bleed O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
want O
any O
extraordinary O
measures O
taken O
. O

Specifically O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
re-banded O
. O

We O
also O
addressed O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
the O
GI O
service O
re-endoscope O
him O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
look O
at O
the O
progression O
of O
his O
esophageal O
banding O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
did O
not O
feel O
that O
that O
made O
any O
sense O
given O
his O
other O
comorbid O
disease O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
very O
adamant O
that O
in O
the O

would O
prefer O

The O
patient O
was O
re-staged O
during O
his O
admission O
with O
a O
urine O
and O
serum O
electroimmunophoresis O
and O
a O
full O
skeletal O
survey O
. O

He O
also O
received O
a O
four-day O
Decadron O
burst O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
pain O
in O
the O
L3 O
distribution O
. O

His O
MRI O
of O
the O
spine O
showed O
no O
clear O
reason O
for O
the O
pain O
and O
thus O
, O
a O
pelvic O
CT O
was O
obtained O
showing O
a O
large O
right O
pelvic O
mass O
that O
likely O
was O
causing O
his O
leg O
pain O
. O

Radiation O
oncology O
was O
scheduled O
for O
next O
Tuesday O
to O
irradiate O
the O
mass O

Although O
there O
was O
a O
T5 O
compression O
fracture O
compressing O
the O
cord O
without O
signal O
change O
, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
that O
this O
lesion O
could O
be O
causing O
his O
urinary O
retention O
; O
and O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
pelvic O
mass O
more O
likely O
accounted O
for O
his O
urinary O
retention O
. O

Fevers O
. O

His O
blood O
and O
urine O
cultures O
were O
obtained O
and O
remained O

The O
patient O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
acute O
pulmonary O
embolus O
and O
his O
shortness O
of O
breath O
resolved O
over O
the O
course O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
T5 O
compression O
fracture O
with O
cord O
deformity O
. O

Neurosurgery O
was O
consulted O
. O

No O
steroids O
were O
recommended O
. O

A O
brace O
was O
ordered O
to O
stabilize O
the O

, O
after O
having O
been O

. O

ASSESSMENT O
: O

The O
assessment O
was O
that O
he O
had O
a O
GI O
bleed O
. O

He O
was O
transfused O
and O
then O
evaluated O
by O
GI O
. O

Endoscopy O
showed O
multiple O
angio O
ectasias O
throughout O
the O
stomach O
. O

He O
received O
multiple O
treatments O
for O
this O
over O
the O
succeeding O
weeks O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
was O
transfused O
. O

His O
platelet O
count O
was O
maintained O
with O
platelet O
transfusion O
as O
necessary O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
Octreotide O
to O
try O
to O
slow O
down O
the O
bleeding O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
measures O
, O
his O
bleeding O
was O
never O
totally O
controlled O
. O

He O
then O
had O
an O
angiogram O
with O
Gel O
foam O
to O
try O
to O
control O
his O
GI O
bleed O
. O

Again O
, O
this O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

At O
that O
point O
he O
had O
a O
change O
in O
mental O
status O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
responsive O
. O

Given O
this O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
make O
his O
care O
comfort O
measures O
only O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
he O
was O
made O
comfort O
measures O
and O
expired O
comfortably O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
death O
was O
a O
combination O
of O
GI O
bleeding O
felt O
to O
be O
ultimately O
related O
to O
his O
known O
metastatic O
pancreatic O
cancer O

and O
this O
was O
complicated O
by O
poor O

ongoing O
hyperkalemia O
which O
was O
managed O
with O

. O

HEENT O

was O
within O
normal O

. O

Examination O
of O
his O
shoulder O
revealed O
the O
patient O
to O
be O
able O
to O
flex O
his O
right O
arm O
to O
170 O
degrees O
, O
internally O

painful O
. O

The O
left O
shoulder O
was O
identical O
in O
range O
of O
motion O
and O
was O
also O
painful O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
with O
the O
assessment O
of O
left O
rotator O
cuff O
repair O
and O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Operating O
Room O
on O
the O
day O
of O
admission O
where O
he O
underwent O
left O
rotator O
cuff O
repair O
under O
general O
endotracheal O
tube O
anesthesia O
. O

There O
were O
no O
intraoperative O
complications O
. O

His O
postoperative O
course O
was O
generally O
unremarkable O
except O
for O
a O
prolonged O
course O
of O
advancement O
with O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
his O
left O
shoulder O
. O

Occupational O
therapy O
became O
involved O
initially O
and O
he O
remained O
on O
patient O
controlled O
analgesia O
secondary O
to O
problems O
with O
left O
shoulder O
pain O
. O

He O
was O
kept O
in O
the O
hospital O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
to O
improve O
his O
postoperative O
range O
of O
motion O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
eventually O
able O
to O
achieve O
forward O
flexion O
of O
135 O
degrees O
and O
external O
rotation O
of O
30 O
degrees O
by O
postoperative O
day O
number O
eight O
. O

His O
wound O
remained O
clean O
and O
dry O
and O
showed O
no O
signs O
of O
infection O
and O
healed O
well O
. O

However O
, O
his O
course O
was O
otherwise O
complicated O
by O
discovery O
of O
persistently O
elevated O
blood O
sugars O
and O
Endocrinology O
was O
consulted O
to O
rule O
out O
possible O
newly O
diagnosed O
diabetes O
. O

His O
hemoglobin O
A1C O
levels O
actually O
came O
back O
within O
normal O
limits O
, O
however O
, O
the O
wide O
excursions O
of O
his O
sugars O
were O
consistent O
with O
possible O
diabetes O
. O

He O
was O
placed O
on O
a O
diabetic O
diet O
and O
his O
sugars O
did O
show O
some O
improvement O
. O

It O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
start O
him O
on O
oral O
hypoglycemics O
or O
insulin O
. O

He O
also O
complained O
of O
occasional O
spells O
and O
jitteriness O
and O
some O
orthostatic O
dizziness O
and O
thus O
Neurology O
was O
consulted O
and O
EMG O
&apos;s O
were O
performed O
which O
were O
normal O
. O

His O
neurologist O
was O
contacted O
, O
Dr. O
Cap B-DOCTOR
, O
and O
the O
exact O
of O
his O
problems O
was O
not O
demonstrated O
during O
this O
hospitalization O
, O
however O
, O
they O
felt O
that O
this O
could O
possibly O
be O
an O
autonomic O
type O
neuropathy O
maybe O
secondary O
to O
some O
underlying O
diabetic O
process O
. O

Further O
work-up O
of O
his O
neurologic O
conditions O
were O
planned O
as O
an O
outpatient O
. O

Thus O
, O
he O
was O
discharged O
on O
postoperative O
day O
number O
eight O
in O
good O
condition O
with O
a O
well O
healed O
left O
shoulder O
wound O
and O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Mr. O
Cliffestreukote B-PATIENT
was O
admitted O
on O
the O
night O
of O
the O
20th B-DATE
, O
for O
obvious O
right O
lung O
pneumonia O
. O

The O
differential O
diagnosis O
included O
several O
organisms O
as O
outlined O
below O
. O

(1) O
Pneumonia O
. O

He O
was O
admitted O
for O
a O
pneumonia O
unresponsive O
to O
antibiotics O
for O
five O
days O
. O

The O
pneumonia O
was O
found O
to O
be O
multilobar O
, O
and O
accompanied O
by O
significant O
hypoxia O
. O

He O
was O
started O
on O
broad O
spectrum O
coverage O
, O
including O
ceftriaxone O
, O
Clindamycin O
, O
and O
Ciprofloxacin O
. O

The O
ration O
off O
for O
the O
utilization O
of O
the O
Ciprofloxacin O
, O
was O
that O
because O
of O
his O
allergy O
to O
Erythromycin O
, O
an O
alternative O
regimen O
was O
needed O
to O
cover O
for O
Legionella O
, O
which O
was O
probably O
the O
leading O
diagnosis O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
, O
because O
of O
his O
hyponatremia O
accompanied O
by O
liver O
function O
abnormalities O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
isolated O
, O
and O
three O
AFB O
smears O
were O
obtained O
, O
in O
order O
to O
rule O
out O
tuberculosis O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
sputum O
induction O
was O
performed O
for O
Pneumocystis O
, O
which O
was O
negative O
. O

His O
urinary O
Legionella O
antigen O
subsequently O
came O
back O
negative O
. O

However O
, O
this O
test O
is O
only O
85-95% O
sensitive O
for O
Legionella O
pneumophila O
, O
type O
I O
, O
which O
is O
the O
subtype O
that O
causes O
some O
80% O
of O
legionnaires O
disease O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Legionella O
antigen O
is O
neither O
sensitive O
, O
nor O
specific O
, O
for O
other O
Legionella O
species O
that O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
Legionella O
pneumonia O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
Ciprofloxacin O
was O
continued O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
his O
sputum O
cultures O
were O
all O
negative O
, O
as O
of O
the O
day O
of O
admission O
. O

After O
admission O
, O
with O
the O
initiation O
of O
antibiotic O
therapy O
, O
Mr. O
Cliffestreukote B-PATIENT
remained O
quite O
hypoxic O
. O

However O
, O
within O
one O
to O
two O
days O
after O
admission O
, O
he O
defervesced O
with O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
his O
cough O
during O
the O
week O
, O
post O
admission O
. O

Because O
of O
persistent O
hypoxemia O
on O
room O
air O
, O
as O
well O
as O
nasal O
cannula O
, O
some O
concern O
was O
raised O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
underlying O
chronic O
obstructive O
pulmonary O
disease O
, O
versus O
some O
other O
lesion O
that O
may O
predispose O
him O
for O
persistent O
hypoxemia O
, O
( O
i.e. O
malignancy O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
an O
evaluation O
by O
the O
Pulmonary O
Team O
of O
the O
Tonwe B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
sputum O
cytology O
and O
chest O
CT O
scan O
, O
were O
all O
obtained O
. O

The O
chest O
CT O
scan O
revealed O
evidence O
for O
emphysematous O
changes O
of O
his O
lungs O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
previously O
noted O
right O
pneumonia O
, O
with O
several O
pseudo O
abscesses O
noted O
in O
infected O
bullae O
. O

His O
sputum O
cytology O
is O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
Pulmonary O
Team O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
significant O
physical O
findings O
, O
laboratory O
values O
, O
and O
radiologic O
features O
, O
all O
consistent O
with O
chronic O
obstructive O
pulmonary O
disease O
. O

Therefore O
, O
his O
persistent O
hypoxemia O
may O
be O
secondary O
to O
that O
underlying O
disease O
. O

Despite O
being O
afebrile O
, O
with O
significant O
decrease O
in O
his O
cough O
, O
Mr. O
Cliffestreukote B-PATIENT
will O
be O
maintained O
, O
after O
discharge O
, O
on O
eleven O
more O
days O
of O
antibiotic O
therapy O
, O
to O
complete O
a O
full O
course O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
, O
that O
Clindamycin O
was O
discontinued O
, O
approximately O
three O
days O
after O
admission O
, O
because O
of O
the O
development O
of O
diarrhea O
. O

Additionally O
, O
when O
switched O
to O
oral O
medication O
, O
Mr. O
Cliffestreukote B-PATIENT
was O
switched O
to O
Augmentin O
500 O
mg. O
p.o. O
t.i.d. O
, O
as O
well O
as O
continuing O
on O
his O
Ciprofloxacin O
150 O
mg. O
p.o. O
b.i.d. O

(2) O
Hypertension O
. O

While O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
Mr. O
Cliffestreukote B-PATIENT
was O
maintained O
on O
hydrochlorothiazide O
, O
and O
Verapamil O
SR O
, O
and O
required O
no O
additional O
medication O
. O

(3) O
Hyponatremia O
. O

While O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
persistent O
type O
of O
natremia O
was O
noted O
on O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
Profile O
7 O
labs O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
due O
largely O
to O
his O
pulmonary O
disease O
, O
and O
would O
resolve O
with O
the O
resolution O
of O
his O
intrapneumonic O
process O
. O

While O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
there O
were O
no O
complications O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

In O
the O
MICU O
, O
the O
patient O
initially O
required O
Dopamine O
for O
five O
days O
, O
at O
which O
point O
, O
she O
tolerated O
a O
wean O
without O
recurrent O
light O
headedness O
, O
dizziness O
or O
syncope O
. O

Echocardiogram O
revealed O
preserved O
ejection O
fraction O
without O
regional O
wall O
motion O
abnormalities O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
Swan-Ganz O
catheter O
placed O
which O
showed O
a O
cardiac O
output O
of O
8 O
with O
systemic O
vascular O
resistance O
of O
700 O
. O

Because O
the O
Swan-Ganz O
readings O
were O
felt O
to O
be O
explained O
by O
sepsis O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
empirically O
with O
Cefotaxime O
, O
Gentamicin O
and O
Flagyl O
. O

All O
cultures O
were O
subsequently O
negative O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
an O
E O
coli O
UTI O
. O

The O
infectious O
workup O
included O
a O
lumbar O
puncture O
which O
was O
negative O
for O
pleocytosis O
but O
showed O
an O
elevated O
glucose O
of O
106 O
and O
an O
elevated O
protein O
of O
76 O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an O
extensive O
workup O
for O
hypopituitarism O
. O

Because O
Addisonian O
crisis O
could O
not O
be O
initially O
ruled O
out O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
placed O
on O
distressed O
dose O
Cortisone O
. O

However O
, O
a O
random O
cortisol O
level O
drawn O
initially O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
subsequently O
returned O
as O
normal O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
responded O
appropriately O
to O
Cortrosyn O
stimulation O
test O
. O

Also O
, O
TSH O
was O
normal O
on O
admission O
. O

Thyroid O
function O
panel O
drawn O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
on O
Dopamine O
was O
subsequently O
abnormal O
. O

However O
, O
repeat O
panel O
was O
drawn O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
stable O
and O
had O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
was O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
evaluated O
by O
the O
neurology O
service O
for O
possible O
dysautonomia O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
with O
an O
inappropriate O
heart O
rate O
response O
to O
hypotension O
. O

EMG O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
. O

Additional O
studies O
also O
included O
a O
head O
CT O
that O
showed O
a O
small O
Lacunar O
infarct O
in O
the O
right O
pons O
and O
a O
partial O
empty O
sella O
which O
was O
confirmed O
by O
head O
MRI O
. O

Other O
studies O
sent O
during O
the O
workup O
included O
a O
negative O
serum O
and O
urine O
protein O
electrophoresis O
, O
negative O
serum O
and O
urine O
immunoglobulin O
electrophoresis O
. O

LH O
and O
SSH O
levels O
were O
consistent O
with O
a O
post-menopausal O
state O
. O

Galactin O
levels O
were O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

ANA O
was O
negative O
. O

Ace O
level O
was O
negative O
. O

Heavy O
metal O
screen O
was O
negative O
except O
for O
a O
slightly O
elevated O
cobalt O
level O
so O
a O
possibility O
of O
a O
perineoplastic O
syndrome O
was O
considered O
. O

An O
anti-YO O
RI O
and O
WHO O
antibodies O
were O
sent O
and O
were O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

On O
hospital O
day O
eight O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
uneventfully O
weaned O
off O
Dopamine O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
stress O
dose O
Hydrocortisone O
was O
weaned O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
switched O
to O
Prednisone O
without O
any O
evidence O
of O
recurrent O
hypotension O
. O

Her O
initial O
hyponatremia O
and O
hypokalemia O
resolved O
with O
stable O
sodium O
and O
potassium O
levels O
prior O
to O
discharge O
. O

In O
the O
studying O
of O
aggressive O
fluid O
resuscitation O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
sent O
into O
pulmonary O
edema O
. O

The O
patient O
auto-diuresed O
spontaneously O
. O

Subsequent O
to O
the O
diuresis O
, O
reticulonodular O
diffuse O
pattern O
became O
apparent O
on O
chest O
x-ray O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
significant O
smoking O
history O
, O
chest O
PT O
was O
performed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
possibility O
of O
lymphangitic O
carcinomatosis O
. O

However O
, O
the O
chest O
CT O
showed O
relative O
sparing O
of O
the O
lower O
lobes O
with O
primary O
involvement O
in O
both O
upper O
lobes O
. O

The O
patient O
following O
diuresis O
had O
no O
oxygen O
requirement O
whatsoever O
and O
had O
no O
respiratory O
complaints O
. O

Prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
she O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
pulmonary O
service O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
differential O
diagnosis O
for O
her O
chest O
CT O
included O
eosinophilic O
granuloma O
, O
idiopathic O
pulmonary O
fibrosis O
, O
less O
likely O
sarcoidosis O
. O

Because O
the O
patient O
had O
no O
respiratory O
symptoms O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
her O
abnormal O
chest O
CT O
would O
be O
best O
evaluated O
as O
an O
out-patient O
. O

A O
new O
baseline O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
obtained O
prior O
to O
discharge O
. O

She O
will O
also O
require O
baseline O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
as O
an O
out-patient O
. O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN O
: O

This O
is O
a O
63-year-old O
lady O
with O
stage O
IV O
colon O
cancer O
, O
status O
post O
three O
chemo O
regimens O
, O
then O
she O
was O
on O
a O
phase O
one O
trial O
. O

She O
presented O
with O
increasing O
LFTs O
and O
renal O
failure O
. O

1. O
Hypertension O
, O
infectious O
disease O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
hypertensive O
to O
60s O
through O
much O
of O
her O
stay O
. O

She O
had O
E. O
coli O
in O
her O
urine O
and O
she O
was O
placed O
on O
Levaquin O
. O

Differential O
diagnosis O
included O
urosepsis O
and O
intravascular O
sleep O
depletion O
. O

Because O
of O
her O
rising O
LFTs O
and O
renal O
failure O
, O
she O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
in O
hepatorenal O
, O
see O
below O
. O

We O
continued O
to O
administer O
serum-poor O
albumin O
throughout O
the O
day O
even O
until O
her O
death O
. O

2. O
Renal O
failure O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
in O
acute O
renal O
failure O
and O
had O
hypertension O
. O

The O
differential O
diagnosis O
included O
hypertension O
, O
hypovolemia O
, O
and O
nephrotoxicity O
due O
to O
the O
drug O
, O
and O
tumor O
lysis O
leading O
to O
hepatorenal O
or O
hepatorenal O
in O
itself O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
renal O
ultrasound O
. O

This O
showed O
mild O
left O
hydronephrosis O
, O
no O
real O
etiology O
for O
this O
. O

Her O
creatinine O
is O
slowly O
climbed O
to O
greater O
than O
4.6 O
upon O
her O
death O
. O

She O
was O
in O
fluid O
restriction O
to O
1.5 O
litres O
a O
day O
. O

Renal O
failure O
was O
thought O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
hypovolemia O
from O
hyperperfusion O
as O
well O
as O
hepatorenal O
syndrome O
. O

We O
continued O
allopurinol O
. O

3. O
Increasing O
LFTs O
and O
INR O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
increasing O
LFTs O
and O
her O
T. O
bili O
climbed O
to O
greater O
than O
9 O
upon O
death O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
hepatorenal O
syndrome O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
patient O
could O
have O
had O
the O
tumor O
metabolizing O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
obstruction O
. O

4. O
The O
patient O
&apos;s O
increased O
LDH O
, O
uric O
acid O
, O
and O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
are O
all O
consistent O
with O
tumor O
lysis O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
an O
increased O
tumor O
burden O
and O
not O
necessarily O
from O
the O
medication O
. O

It O
became O
clear O
throughout O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hospital O
course O
that O
she O
was O
becoming O
very O
sick O
and O
the O
patient O
accepted O
this O
. O

With O
her O
wishes O
that O
her O
she O
was O
DNR O
/ O
DNI O
, O
we O
eventually O
made O
her O

. O

She O
was O
awake O
and O
entertaining O
friends O
and O
family O
through O
most O
of O
her O
hospital O
stay O
. O

She O
often O
may O
talk O
openly O
about O
her O
death O
that O
was O
impending O
. O

On O
the O
two O
days O
prior O
to O
her O
death O
, O
she O
was O
more O
unresponsive O
and O
on O
the O
day O
of O
her O
death O
, O
she O
was O
unconscious O
through O
most O
of O
the O
day O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
pronounced O
dead O
at O
6:50 O
p.m. O
on O
04/16 B-DATE

on O
11/16 B-DATE
04 O
given O
her O
history O
of O
COPD O
, O
but O
the O
stress O
portion O
was O
canceled O
when O
she O
was O
down O
there O
due O
to O
fever O
and O
hypotension O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
she O
underwent O
a O
cardiac O
echo O
( O
transthoracic O

, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
RVSP O
given O

On O
hospital O
day O
#2 O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
increased O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
. O

The O
next O
day O
she O
developed O
a O
fever O
and O
she O
was O
started O
on O
levofloxacin O
for O
a O
potential O
UTI O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
low-grade O
fevers O
and O
on O
the O
next O
day O
, O
11/17 B-DATE
04 O
, O
her O
chest O
x-ray O
showed O
possible O
new O
right O
upper O
lobe O
infiltrates O
. O

She O
was O
then O
started O
on O
ceftriaxone O
and O
azithromycin O
. O

Her O
urine O
legionella O
antigen O
was O
negative O
. O

On O
11/22 B-DATE
04 O
, O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
gram-positive O
cocci O
in O
her O
sputum O
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
vancomycin O
for O
this O
. O

These O
bacteria O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
MRSA O
and O
she O
was O
continued O
on O
her O
vancomycin O
. O

She O
had O
PICC O
line O
placed O
on O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
for O
home O
vancomycin O
administration O
. O

3. O
GI O
: O

The O
patient O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
nausea O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
11/16 B-DATE
04 O
associated O
with O
some O
cough O
, O
apparent O
emesis O
. O

GI O
was O
consulted O
for O
an O
EGD O
, O
however O
, O
while O
she O
was O
in O
the O
Endoscopy O
Suite O
, O
as O
mentioned O
above O
, O
she O
had O
a O
hypotensive O
episode O
, O
which O
responded O
to O
some O
fluid O
boluses O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
she O
was O
stabilized O
to O
the O
point O
that O
she O
could O
have O
her O
EGD O
. O

The O
EGD O
did O
show O
three O
esophageal O
ulcers O
that O
were O
localized O
and O
apparent O
suggestion O
of O
pill O
esophagitis O
. O

Her O
stomach O
and O
duodenum O
were O
normal O
and O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
she O
change O
her O
Nexium O
doses O
to O
daily O
and O
that O
she O
also O
drink O
plenty O
of O
fluids O
and O
water O
with O
meals O
, O
sit O
upright O
when O
she O
would O
eat O
her O
meals O
to O
decrease O
the O
chance O
of O
pills O
eroding O
her O
esophagus O
. O

4. O
Shortness O
of O
breath O
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
develop O
MRSA O
pneumonia O
that O
was O
started O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
vancomycin O
and O
she O
did O
also O
develop O
an O
oxygen O
requirement O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
. O

At O
most O
, O
her O
oxygen O
requirement O
was O
4-5 O
liters O
and O
on O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
she O
was O
satting O
well O
on O
two O
liters O
of O
nasal O
cannula O
. O

This O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
her O
pneumonia O
; O
however O
, O
with O
her O
right O
ventricular O
hypokinesis O
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
she O
may O
have O
an O
element O
of O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
and O
may O
warrant O
further O
investigation O
as O
an O
outpatient O
, O
for O
example O
, O
with O
chest O
CT O
. O

5. O
Derm O
: O

Several O
days O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
some O
erythematous O
rash O
under O
her O
left O
breast O
and O
left O
side O
that O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
yeast O
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
some O
Miconazole O
Cream O
. O

The O
rash O
was O
always O
localized O
to O
her O
left O
side O
, O
sometimes O
extending O
down O
to O
her O
leg O
, O
but O
never O
on O
the O
right O
side O
. O

The O
rash O
appeared O
to O
be O
resolving O
by O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
a O
telemetry O
bed O
and O
started O
on O
heparin O
. O

Around O
4:00 O
AM O
the O
next O
day O
, O
an O
acute O
decompensation O
in O
respiratory O
status O
was O
noted O
. O

at O
that O
point O
showed O
good O
air O
entry O
, O
no O
wheezing O
, O
coarse O
breath O
sounds O
throughout O
. O

Neurologically O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
following O
commands O
. O

Eyes O
were O
closed O
. O

He O
was O
moving O
the O
right O
arm O
and O
leg O
spontaneously O
, O
though O
less O
than O
before O
. O

Withdrawal O
to O
pain O
was O
still O
present O
. O

Both O
plantars O
were O
upgoing O
. O

A O
blood O

at O
this O
point O
showed O
a O
pH O
of O

, O

61 O
, O
pCO2 O
of O
33 O
on O
100% O
non-rebreather O
mask O
. O

EKG O
showed O
sinus O
tachycardia O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
temperature O
was O
102 O
degrees O
. O

A O
repeat O
CAT O
scan O
of O
the O
head O
was O
performed O
. O

This O
showed O
continued O
evolution O
of O
the O
right O
posterior O
cerebral O
artery O
infarction O
now O
extending O
into O
the O
right O
cerebellar O
hemisphere O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
high O
density O
adjacent O
to O
the O
right O
cerebellar O
infarction O
suggesting O
the O
presence O
of O
hemorrhage O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
. O

An O
MRI O
and O
MRA O
of O
the O
head O
was O
arranged O
to O
evaluate O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
stroke O
and O
the O
posterior O
circulation O
. O

The O
MRI O
showed O
infarct O
of O
the O
cerebellar O
hemispheres O
bilaterally O
, O
the O
right O
occipital O
lobe O
, O
the O
right O
thalamus O
and O
bilateral O
pons O
. O

The O
MRA O
of O
the O
intracranial O
circulation O
demonstrated O
gross O
patency O
of O
the O
internal O
carotid O
arteries O
bilaterally O
and O
the O
basilar O
arteries O
. O

The O
left O
vertebral O
artery O
was O
not O
visualized O
. O

There O
was O
a O
dominant O
right O
vertebral O
artery O
. O

There O
was O
mildly O
reduced O
flow O
in O
the O
branches O
of O
the O
right O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
compared O
to O
the O
left O
. O

There O
was O
visualization O
of O
flow O
within O
both O
posterior O
cerebral O
arteries O
. O

Clinically O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
. O

Neurosurgery O
was O
consulted O
, O
however O
the O
neurosurgeons O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
surgical O
option O
, O
since O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
cerebellar O
swelling O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
improvement O
from O
decompensation O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
therefore O
treated O
conservatively O
with O
fluid O
restriction O
and O
blood O
pressure O
management O
. O

Heparin O
was O
discontinued O
because O
of O
the O
risk O
of O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
and O
given O
a O
course O
of O
p.o. O
antibiotics O
including O
Levofloxacin O
and O
Flagyl O
with O
plans O
for O
a O
fourteen O
day O
course O
. O

He O
initially O
received O
oxygen O
, O
two O
liters O
via O
nasal O
cannula O
, O
but O
had O
an O
oxygen O
saturation O
that O
remained O
at O
92% O
on O
room O
air O
, O
so O
oxygen O
was O
discontinued O
. O

His O
potassium O
was O
repleted O
from O
2.6 O
up O
to O
3.3 O
the O
day O
after O
admission O
and O
then O
up O
to O
4.2 O
two O
days O
after O
admission O
. O

The O
source O
for O
his O
hypokalemia O
was O
unknown O
. O

He O
initially O
had O
watery O
diarrhea O
, O
thought O
secondary O
to O
soap O
ingestion O
which O
resolved O
two O
days O
after O
admission O
. O

He O
was O
gently O
hydrated O
with O
1/2 O
normal O
saline O
for O
two O
liters O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
his O
gastrointestinal O
losses O
. O

He O
was O
continued O
on O
Risperdal O
which O
he O
takes O
for O
dementia O
. O

He O
did O
have O
fevers O
the O
day O
after O
admission O
, O
but O
his O
fever O
curve O
gradually O
came O
down O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
question O
of O
aspiration O
, O
a O
Speech O
and O
Swallow O
evaluation O
was O
obtained O
. O

Before O
this O
evaluation O
, O
discussion O
was O
undertaken O
with O
the O
family O
who O
decided O
that O
even O
if O
the O
patient O
were O
aspirating O
that O
they O
would O
not O
want O
a O
feeding O
jejunal O
tube O
for O
feeding O
placed O
. O

Speech O
evaluation O
felt O
that O
he O
may O
be O
aspirating O
occasionally O
when O
he O
coughs O
, O
however O
they O
did O
not O
recommend O
dietary O
modifications O
, O
but O
only O
that O
he O
be O
given O
soft O
, O
easily O
chewed O
items O
. O

They O
also O
suggested O
that O
he O
be O
observed O
at O
meals O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
he O
paces O
himself O
to O
avoid O
aspirating O
. O

They O
recommended O
follow-up O
evaluation O
if O
he O
develops O
further O
pneumonias O
or O
if O
he O
has O
increased O
coughing O
. O

This O
can O
be O
arranged O
through O
his O
primary O
care O
physician O
or O
through O
the O
rehabilitation O
hospital O
if O
he O
is O
still O
an O
inpatient O
at O
rehabilitation O
. O

The O
family O
also O
decided O
to O
make O
the O
patient O
DNR O
/ O
DNI O
after O
he O
was O
admitted O
. O

He O
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
rehabilitation O
to O
finish O
his O
course O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
to O
work O
on O
ambulation O
. O

He O
will O
then O
return O
home O
with O
HMC B-HOSPITAL
services O
to O
live O
with O
his O
daughter-in-law O
and O
son O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
with O
a O
principle O
diagnosis O
of O
likely O
perforated O
appendicitis O
. O

She O
was O
admitted O
and O
put O
on O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
with O
plan O
of O
obtaining O
an O
abdominopelvic O
CT O
scan O
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
admission O
, O
an O
abdominopelvic O
CAT O
scan O
was O
obtained O
which O
showed O
dilated O
loops O
of O
fluid O
filled O
bowel O
and O
colon O
in O
the O
right O
lower O
quadrant O
. O

The O
colon O
was O
decompressed O
distally O
and O
there O
was O
no O
contrast O
seen O
in O
the O
lower O
intestine O
. O

This O
was O
thought O
to O
represent O
at O
least O
a O
partial O
small O
bowel O
obstruction O
or O
possibly O
an O
ileus O
. O

There O
were O
some O
bubbles O
of O
free O
air O
which O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
extraluminal O
. O

The O
primary O
diagnosis O
at O
that O
time O
was O
complicated O
or O
perforated O
appendicitis O
with O
partial O
small O
bowel O
obstruction O
. O

A O
delayed O
CT O
scan O
was O
planned O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
contrast O
through O
the O
lower O
intestine O
and O
on O
this O
delayed O
CT O
scan O
, O
contrast O
was O
seen O
passing O
distally O
through O
the O
lower O
intestine O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
on O
hospital O
day O
one O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
perforated O
appendicitis O
and O
right O
lower O
quadrant O
phlegmon O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
this O
course O
of O
action O
would O
be O
to O
either O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
or O
attempt O
to O
stabilize O
the O
patient O
with O
intravenous O
fluids O
, O
antibiotics O
, O
and O
possibly O
wait O
for O
six O
weeks O
for O
elective O
appendectomy O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
triple O
antibiotics O
of O
ampicillin O
, O
Gentamicin O
, O
and O
Flagyl O
, O
kept O
NPO O
, O
and O
serial O
examinations O
were O
obtained O
. O

Over O
the O
first O
three O
hospital O
days O
, O
her O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
fell O
to O
under O
10,000 O
. O

Sips O
of O
clear O
liquids O
were O
started O
and O
were O
tolerated O
without O
complication O
. O

Patient O
&apos;s O
physical O
examination O
remained O
relatively O
unremarkable O
, O
however O
, O
she O
began O
to O
develop O
slight O
abdominal O
distention O
. O

After O
the O
patient O
was O
tolerating O
clear O
sips O
, O
she O
was O
given O
one O
liter O
of O
Golytely O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
clearing O
out O
her O
bowel O
in O
case O
surgery O
was O
needed O
. O

Repeat O
CAT O
scan O
was O
obtained O
on O
hospital O
day O
five O
. O

This O
CAT O
scan O
was O
relatively O
unchanged O
showing O
matted O
loops O
of O
bowel O
in O
the O
right O
lower O
quadrant O
. O

The O
appendix O
was O
not O
well O
visualized O
. O

The O
repeat O
CT O
scan O
also O
showed O
contained O
fluid O
collections O
in O
the O
pelvis O
and O
these O
were O
not O
felt O
to O
be O
communicating O
. O

These O
were O
also O
not O
felt O
to O
be O
collections O
which O
could O
be O
drained O
by O
interventional O
radiology O
. O

Given O
the O
progression O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
CAT O
scan O
and O
the O
relative O
nonprogression O
of O
her O
clinical O
course O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
after O
discussion O
with O
the O
patient O
to O
proceed O
with O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
and O
likely O
ileocecectomy O
with O
secondary O
wound O
closure O
. O

Patient O
&apos;s O
bowel O
was O
further O
prepared O
with O
p.o. O
erythromycin O
and O
neomycin O
base O
in O
one O
additional O
liter O
of O
