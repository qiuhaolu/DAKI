HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

I O
indicated O
to O
Dr. O
Brown B-DOCTOR
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
situation O
in O
which O
an O
adult O
had O
stenosed O
aortic O
valve O
so O
rapidly O
, O
but O
certainly O
his O
clinical O
signs O
suggested O
aortic O
stenosis O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
on O
April B-DATE
2 I-DATE
, O
1993 O
, O
he O
underwent O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
. O

The O
study O
showed O
that O
the O
right O
internal O
mammary O
and O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
grafts O
were O
patent O
to O
the O
distal O
vessels O
. O

The O
right O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
was O
also O
patent O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
high O
grade O
narrowing O
in O
the O
vessel O
beyond O
it O
. O

Using O
transeptal O
catheterization O
, O
he O
proved O
to O
have O
a O
70 O
mm O
gradient O
across O
the O
aortic O
valve O
and O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
about O
his O
aortic O
stenosis O
. O

The O
left O
ventricular O
contraction O
showed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
around O
25% O
. O

An O
attempt O
at O
transesophageal O
echocardiogram O
was O
unsuccessful O
, O
because O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
cooperative O
. O

On O
April B-DATE
8 I-DATE
, O
1993 O
, O
Dr. O
G B-DOCTOR
Hemp I-DOCTOR
performed O
open O
heart O
surgery O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
operation O
, O
the O
porcine O
valve O
showed O
a O
heavy O
fibrous O
pannus O
underneath O
the O
valve O
, O
and O
there O
was O
what O
looked O
like O
organized O
thrombus O
in O
the O
leaflets O
which O
impeded O
leaflet O
movement O
. O

There O
was O
no O
calcification O
of O
the O
valve O
, O
and O
no O
clear O
evidence O
of O
infection O
. O

I O
have O
in O
fact O
never O
seen O
anything O
quite O
like O
this O
on O
an O
aortic O
porcine O
valve O
. O

The O
valve O
was O
replaced O
, O
and O
a O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
was O
then O
constructed O
from O
the O
distal O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
that O
was O
already O
in O
place O
to O
the O
distal O
right O
coronary O
artery O
beyond O
the O
obstruction O
. O

The O
surgery O
was O
very O
difficult O
, O
because O
of O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
scarring O
from O
the O
previous O
operation O
, O
but O
generally O
things O
went O
along O
smoothly O
. O

Mr. O
No B-PATIENT
was O
on O
the O
pump O
for O
2 O
hours O
and O
25 O
minutes O
, O
with O
an O
aortic O
crossclamp O
time O
of O
1 O
hour O
and O
48 O
minutes O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
extubated O
on O
the O
first O
postoperative O
day O
. O

He O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pulmonary O
congestion O
. O

He O
seemed O
to O
be O
doing O
well O
until O
the O
morning O
of O
4-13 B-DATE
93 O
when O
he O
suddenly O
became O
pulseless O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
ventricular O
fibrillation O
. O

Cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
was O
immediately O
undertaken O
, O
but O
was O
not O
successful O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
his O
chest O
opened O
for O
any O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
and O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
bleeding O
. O

The O
heart O
appeared O
to O
be O
flaccid O
. O

We O
really O
have O
no O
good O
explanation O
of O
what O
this O
was O
all O
about O
. O

He O
was O
being O
treated O
for O
a O
possible O
pneumonia O
. O

He O
did O
have O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pulmonary O
congestion O
, O
but O
this O
occurred O
suddenly O
and O
unexpectedly O
. O

Cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
efforts O
were O
carried O
out O
for O
virtually O
one O
hour O
, O
but O
were O
unsuccessful O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
pronounced O
dead O
on O
the O
morning O
of O

and O
nitroglycerin O
. O

Post-procedure O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O

because O
of O
the O
history O
of O

dissection O
. O

He O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
but O
of O
note O
, O
would O
not O
tolerate O
a O
transesophageal O

was O
noted O
to O
be O
18% O
with O
global O
hypokinesis O
. O

The O
next O
several O
days O
were O
remarkable O
for O
events O
in O
which O
the O
patient O
was O
quite O
agitated O
and O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Psychiatry O
and O
treated O
with O

postoperatively O
with O
stable O
hemodynamics O
on O
Lidocaine O
at O

and O
Nipride O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
extubated O
by O
postoperative O
day O
# O

but O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
relatively O
hypoxemic O
with O
high O
oxygen O
requirement O
. O

Chest O
x-ray O
demonstrating O
pulmonary O
edema O
. O

Aggressive O
diuresis O
was O
undertaken O
and O
the O
patient O
responded O
, O
albeit O
sluggishly O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
remained O
agitated O
. O

This O
was O
attributed O
to O
mild O
hypoxia O
and O
/ O
or O
his O
underlying O
psychiatric O
diagnoses O
and O
he O
was O
treated O
with O
Haldol O
appropriately O
. O

On O
day O
# O
2 O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
diurese O
and O
this O
was O
maintained O
with O
the O
Lasix/ O
Mannitol O
infusion O
. O

His O
urine O
output O
remained O
at O
150 O
to O
200 O
cc. O
an O
hour O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
his O
chest O
x-ray O
continued O
to O
show O
severe O
pulmonary O
edema O
and O
the O
clinical O
picture O
correlated O
. O

He O
required O
anti-hypertensive O
therapy O
initially O
with O
Nipride O
which O
was O
changed O
to O
Hydralazine O
to O
avoid O
shunting O
. O

He O
received O
several O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
to O
increase O
his O
hematocrit O
and O
oncotic O
pressure O
. O

Very O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
on O
postoperative O
day O
# O
3 O
, O
the O
patient O
became O
acutely O
hypoxic O
after O
several O
hours O
of O
marginal O
oxygenation O
with O
respiratory O
rates O
in O
the O
thirties O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
urgently O
intubated O
, O
without O
complication O
. O

With O
positive O
pressure O
ventilation O
and O
continued O
diuresis O
, O
his O
arterial O
blood O
gases O
improved O
. O

Throughout O
this O
he O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
. O

Exception O
was O
a O
ten O
beat O
run O
of O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
which O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
ischemic O
in O
origin O
and O
treated O
with O
nitrates O
and O
Lidocaine O
. O

His O
chest O
x-ray O
blossomed O
to O
demonstrate O
pulmonary O
infiltrate O
and O
the O
patient O
began O
to O
produce O
sputum O
. O

Infectious O
Disease O
consultation O
was O
obtained O
for O
evaluation O
of O
his O
purulent O
sputum O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
covered O
with O
Vancomycin O
, O
Ceftazidime O
and O
Gentamicin O
. O

Cardiology O
evaluation O
commented O
on O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
increasing O
ventricular O
ectopy O
and O
suggested O
that O
these O
were O
due O
to O
an O
R O
and O
T O
phenomenon O
from O
his O
pacer O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
prolonged O
QT O
interval O
. O

Consequently O
his O
Pronestyl O
was O
discontinued O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
given O
magnesium O
to O
bring O
his O
level O
above O
2 O
. O

On O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
18th B-DATE
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
remain O
hemodynamically O
stable O
, O
although O
his O
oxygenation O
was O
clearly O
deteriorating O
and O
more O
marginal O
. O

On O
60% O
FIO2 O
his O
pO2 O
was O
63 O
. O

It O
was O
increased O
to O
65% O
with O
pO2 O
of O
81 O
. O

At O
approximately O
7:50 O
a.m. O
, O
house O
officer O
was O
called O
to O
the O
room O
for O
blood O
pressure O
of O
70/40 O
with O
falling O
oxygen O
saturations O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
immediately O
given O
400 O
mg. O
of O
Calcium O
Chloride O
i.v. O
push O
and O
ventilator O
disconnected O
and O
the O
patient O
manually O
ventilated O
. O

Within O
one O
minute O
, O
the O
patient O
lost O
his O
blood O
pressure O
and O
CPR O
was O
initiated O
and O
code O
was O
called O
. O

The O
patient O
initially O
continued O
to O
have O
rhythm O
consistent O
with O
EMV O
and O
he O
was O
bolused O
with O
Levophed O
and O
given O
some O

while O
compressions O
continued O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
prothrombin O
time O
had O
been O
23 O
early O
the O
same O
morning O
and O
tamponade O
was O
considered O
and O
thoracotomy O
instruments O
obtained O
. O

The O
chest O
was O
opened O
partially O
and O
through O
sub-xyphoid O
area O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
tamponade O
. O

Compressions O
were O
continued O
and O
adequate O
pulse O
was O
felt O
and O
arterial O
blood O
gases O
demonstrated O
adequate O
oxygenation O
and O
perfusion O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
rhythm O
degenerated O
to O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
and O
he O
was O
shocked O
, O
initially O
without O
response O
but O
after O
several O
doses O
of O
Epinephine O
, O
one-half O
mg. O
of O
Atropine O

we O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
a O

only O
briefly O
, O
and O
quickly O
deteriorated O
back O
to O

was O
noted O
due O
to O
a O
bacterial O
peritonitis O
, O
which O
gradually O
cleared O
over O
several O
days O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
history O
of O
asystole O
, O
she O
was O
discussed O
with O
Dr. O
White B-DOCTOR
as O
a O
possible O
transplant O
candidate O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
significant O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
should O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
a O
gaited O
blood O
pool O
scan O
was O
done O
with O
a O
45% O
ejection O
fraction O
. O

A O
Persantine O
Thallium O
stress O
test O
was O
done O
, O
which O
was O
negative O
for O
ischemia O
. O

Her O
diabetes O
mellitus O
was O
managed O
on O
a O
sliding O
scale O
, O
and O
she O
had O
one O
episode O
of O
hypoglycemia O
, O
secondary O
to O
fasting O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
officially O
evaluated O
for O
transplantation O
by O
Dr. O
White B-DOCTOR
, O
who O
felt O
, O
although O
there O
was O
no O
absolute O
contraindication O
to O
transplantation O
, O
that O
her O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
made O
her O
a O
poor O
candidate O
, O
and O
that O
her O
chronic O
disability O
since O
a O
previous O
auto O
accident O
made O
it O
unlikely O
that O
she O
would O
ever O
be O
returned O
to O
useful O
function O
. O

An O
upper O
gastrointestinal O
endoscopy O
was O
performed O
on O
4/23 B-DATE
92 O
and O
revealed O
portal O
hypertension O
gastropathy O
, O
and O
grade O
4 O
varices O
of O
the O
esophagus O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
she O
began O
to O
diuresis O
effectively O
on O
oral O
antibiotics O
, O
and O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
were O
discontinued O
after O
ten O
days O
and O
repeat O
paracentesis O
performed O
with O
only O
320 O
white O
cells O
, O
with O
no O
preponderance O
of O
polys O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
difficult O
to O
mobilize O
, O
and O
required O
the O
assistance O
of O
her O
family O
as O
her O
diuresis O
progressed O
, O
eventually O
the O
diuretic O
program O
had O
to O
be O
reduced O
because O
of O
a O
drop O
in O
her O
weight O
, O
associated O
with O
nausea O
and O
weakness O
, O
with O
her O
weight O
eventually O
falling O
down O
to O
123 O
pounds O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
maximum O
diuresis O
, O
she O
developed O
lethargy O
, O
and O
cramping O
of O
her O
extremities O
, O
and O
the O
diuretics O
had O
to O
be O
temporarily O
discontinued O
, O
and O
an O
optimum O
weight O
was O
finally O
decided O
upon O
, O
that O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
between O
126 O
and O
128 O
. O

This O
period O
of O
time O
there O
was O
a O
brief O
increase O
in O
her O
SGOT O
from O
the O

. O

This O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
insighting O
cause O
of O
his O
massive O
rhabdomyolysis O
and O
hepatic O
failure O
. O

7-Pneumonia O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
two O
pneumonias O
with O
two O
separate O
organisms O
. O

The O
first O
was O
Acinetobacter O
calcoaceticus O
subspecies O
anitratus O
, O
treated O
with O
Ciprofloxacin O
and O
Gentamicin O
. O

He O
subsequently O
developed O
a O
staphylococcus O
aureus O
pneumonia O
which O
was O
treated O
with O
Vancomycin O
, O
dosed O
to O
levels O
appropriate O
for O
his O
renal O
failure O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
who O
advised O
us O
on O
antibiotic O
choices O
daily O
. O

8-Pancreatitis O
. O

The O
amylase O
on O
admission O
was O
279 O
with O
a O
lipase O
of O
161 O
. O

Although O
not O
fully O
this O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
his O
hypocalcemia O
and O
volume O
requirements O
. O

9-Catheter O
tip O
infections O
. O

The O
patient O
grew O
out O
coagulase O
negative O
staphylococcus O
from O
the O
femoral O
lines O
which O
were O
placed O
during O
his O
profound O
hypertension O
. O

These O
were O
treated O
with O
Vancomycin O
. O

10-Anemia O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
hematocrit O
was O
33% O
on O
admission O
and O
fell O
to O
28 O
requiring O
4 O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
over O
the O
course O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
. O

11-Coma O
. O

The O
patient O
, O
although O
initially O
minimally O
responsive O
, O
went O
on O
to O
develop O
a O
deep O
comatose O
state O
. O

A O
CT O
scan O
on O
admission O
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O
hemorrhage O
though O
he O
did O
have O
sphenoid O
sinusitis O
. O

The O
lumbar O
puncture O
and O
sinus O
exploration O
were O
unable O
to O
be O
performed O
given O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
persistent O
coagulopathy O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
empirically O
with O
Nafcillin O
and O
Ceftriaxone O
for O
meningitis O
and O
sinusitis O
. O

Further O
complicating O
this O
was O
his O
profound O
liver O
failure O
with O
rising O
ammonias O
and O
hepatic O
encephalopathy O
. O

Despite O
maximal O
supports O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
hypotensive O
. O

Mid-way O
through O
his O
hospital O
course O
he O
developed O
trilobar O
pneumonia O
and O
this O
was O
probably O
complicated O
further O
by O
adult O
respiratory O
distress O
syndrome O
and O
the O
multi-organ O
system O
failure O
syndrome O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
mechanically O
ventilated O
throughout O
his O
hospitalization O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
developed O
refractory O
hypoxemia O
, O
hypotension O
, O
and O
ultimately O
the O
patient O
died O
despite O
total O
life O
support O

for O
careful O
internal O
medical O
evaluation O
has O
arisen O
. O

At O
the O
time O
we O
were O
to O
embark O
on O
this O
evaluation O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
strongly O
requested O
that O
she O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Sas B-HOSPITAL
General I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
. O

What O
follows O
is O
a O
summary O
of O
her O
medical O
problems O
and O
their O
possible O
relationship O
to O
her O
ataxia O
. O

Her O
ataxia O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
some O
cerebellar O
function O
, O
though O
this O
is O
not O
certain O
. O

Moreover O
her O
MRI O
did O
not O
show O
any O
discrete O
cerebellar O
lesions O
. O

Our O
leading O
theory O
at O
this O
point O
is O
that O
her O
cerebellar O
dysfunction O
relates O
to O
perineoplastic O
syndrome O
, O
relating O
to O
her O
history O
of O
breast O
Ca O
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
above O
, O
her O
evaluation O
was O
limited O
by O
her O
cardiologic O
status O
at O
the O
time O
. O

While O
mammogram O
and O
CA-15.3 O
and O
breast O
exam O
are O
all O
normal O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
perineoplastic O
syndrome O
with O
or O
without O
concomitant O
breast O
Ca O
has O
reared O
its O
head O
. O

Two O
possible O
markers O
are O
anti-Hu O
syndrome O
and O
anti-Yo O
antibody O
. O

These O
tests O
were O
sent O
on O
the O
18th B-DATE
and O
are O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
results O

. O

I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
furnish O
the O
results O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
MI O
in O
1989 O
. O

Echocardiogram O
no O
longer O
shows O
wall O
motion O
abnormalities O
. O

EKG O
, O
when O
the O
patient O
goes O
out O
of O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block O
transiently O
shows O
an O
anterolateral O
Q/wave O
inversion O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
discontinue O
her O
Isordil O
to O
improve O
upon O
some O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
certain O
whether O
her O
heart O
will O
tolerate O
this O
. O

Persantine O
thallium O
is O
scheduled O
at O
this O
time O
, O
but O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
x O
many O
years O
. O

It O
has O
been O
evaluated O
in O
the O
past O
without O
success O
. O

During O
her O
hospitalization O
, O
we O
confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
, O
even O
when O
she O
was O
hydrated O
with O
saline O
, O
to O
a O
fractional O
excretion O
of O
sodium O
of O
2% O
. O

Studies O
of O
her O
autonomic O
system O
did O
not O
document O
any O
dysautonomia O
. O

Studies O
of O
skin O
galvanic O
conduction O
were O
normal O
and O
her O
RR O
interval O
evaluation O
was O
not O
abnormal O
. O

This O
is O
a O
chronic O
problem O
but O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her O
current O
weakness O
and O
inability O
to O
walk O
. O

Florinef O
is O
to O
be O
considered O
, O
however O
stopping O
the O
Isordil O
is O
one O
goal O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
bronchiectasis O
from O
a O
childhood O
pneumonia O
. O

In O
addition O
there O
is O
a O
distant O
history O
of O
M. O
kansasaii O
infection O
. O

This O
has O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Screen B-DOCTOR
at O
Sas B-HOSPITAL
General I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
and O
probably O
relates O
to O
her O
lung O
xray O
. O

CT O
at O
the O
Ona B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
in O
1989 O
showed O
similar O
findings O
. O

A O
chest O
CT O
was O
to O
be O
performed O
and O
may O
be O
yielding O
. O

A O
PPD O
was O
placed O
and O
is O
to O
be O
read O
on O
Saturday O
, O
4 B-DATE
26th I-DATE
. O

The O
left O
volar O
forearm O
has O
the O
PPD O
just O
proximal O
to O
the O
wrist O
crease O
and O
a O
candida O
albicans O
placed O
just O
distal O
to O
the O
antecubital O
fossa O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
deep O
venous O
thrombosis O
in O
1990 O
, O
for O
which O
she O
received O
6 O
months O
of O
Coumadin O
. O

Dopplers O
of O
her O
lower O
extremities O
were O
negative O
on O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
is O
doubtful O
that O
she O
has O
chronic O
PE O
, O
but O
this O
is O
one O
consideration O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
she O
has O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
from O
her O
lung O
disease O
, O
and O
so O
this O
is O
a O
consideration O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
mild O
hyponatremia O
during O
this O
hospitalization O
with O
a O
sodium O
as O
low O
as O
131 O
. O

We O
think O
this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
an O
SIADH O
as O
she O
is O
euvolemic O
. O

This O
can O
be O
evaluated O
further O
and O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
glaucoma O
. O

Her O
medications O
are O

with O
the O
elevated O
white O
blood O

Dr. O
Jescdrig B-DOCTOR
felt O
that O
the O

As O
a O
result O
she O
was O
taken O
back O

room O
on O
6/2 B-DATE
94 O
and O
under O
cystoscopy O
the O
old O
stents O
were O
removed O
and O
new O
larger O
stents O
were O
placed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
Ampicillin O
and O
Gentamicin O
for O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
which O
ultimately O
grew O
out O
Escherichia O

sensitive O
to O
the O
above O
antibiotics O
and O
for O
right O
lower O
lobe O
pneumonia O
on O
x-ray O
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
nebulizers O
around-the-clock O
and O
chest O
physical O
therapy O
. O

Sputum O
culture O
was O
sent O
but O
failed O
to O
identify O
an O
infective O

. O

On O
the O
above O
regimen O
the O
patient O
showed O
marked O
improvement O
. O

Her O
urinary O
output O
remained O
good O
at O
80-100 O
ccs. O
per O
hour O
. O

However O
, O
her O
BUN O
and O

remained O
elevated O
. O

On O
6/5 B-DATE
94 O
they O
were O
21 O

On O
June B-DATE
5 I-DATE
, O

enough O
with O
a O
line O
2 O
cycle O
I O
chemotherapy O
with O
Ifex O
, O
Adriamycin O
and O
MESNA O
. O

She O
was O
therefore O
well O
hydrated O
and O
was O
started O
on O
her O
chemotherapy O
. O

In O
view O
of O
her O
kidney O
damage O
it O
was O
suggested O
to O
change O
her O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
from O
Ancef O
and O
Gentamicin O
to O
Ancef O
and O
ciprofloxacin O
which O
she O
tolerated O
well O
. O

On O
6/7 B-DATE
94 O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
be O
mildly O
confused O
with O
persistent O
nausea O
and O
malaise O
. O

Urinary O
electrolytes O
were O
noted O
to O
be O
within O
normal O
limits O
but O
her O
confusion O
persisted O
. O

A O
Neuro-Oncology O
consult O
was O
sought O
which O
felt O
this O
was O
probably O
secondary O
to O
Ifex O
intoxication O
and O
her O
chemotherapy O
was O
stopped O
. O

An O
electroencephalogram O
was O
requested O
and O
was O
negative O
. O

No O
computerized O

scan O
or O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
of O
the O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
persistent O
nausea O

vomiting O
with O
large O

through O
the O
nasogastric O
tube O
between O
1200 O

1500 O
ccs. O
for O
24 O
hours O
. O

Off O
her O
Ifex O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
sensorium O
slowly O
cleared O
but O
the O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
persisted O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
a O
barium O
study O
was O
performed O
on O
6/12 B-DATE
94 O
which O
showed O
a O
fixed O
stricture O
at O
the O

She O
was O
maintained O
on O
intravenous O
antibiotics O

therapy O
was O
started O
because O
of O
the O
profound O
neutropenia O

carefully O
looked O
at O
the O
entire O
liver O
. O

The O
mass O
that O
had O
been O
seen O
on O
computerized O
tomography O
scan O
and O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
simple O
cyst O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
liver O
looked O
perfectly O
normal O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
and O
postoperatively O
had O
a O
relatively O
uneventful O
course O
. O

She O
was O
advanced O
slowly O
to O
a O
regular O
diet O
. O

She O
did O
have O
some O
persistent O
fever O
after O
the O
operation O
with O
a O
white O
blood O
count O
in O
the O
14-15,000 O
range O

was O
in O
the O
101 O

. O

She O
said O
that O
she O
routinely O
runs O
fevers O
to O
101 O
or O
102 O
at O
home O
and O
has O
for O
years O
, O
and O
insisted O
upon O
going O
home O
. O

This O
seemed O
reasonable O
given O
there O
was O
no O
identifiable O
source O
for O
a O
fever O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
and O
she O
promised O
close O

for O
any O
problems O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
her O
CEA O
upon O
admission O
was O
13.9 O
, O
indicating O
that O
she O
must O
have O
tumor O
somewhere O
. O

She O
underwent O
a O
computerized O

scan O
of O
the O
chest O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
which O
demonstrated O
no O
evidence O
of O

. O

She O
also O
underwent O
a O
bone O
scan O
by O
Nuclear O
Radiology O
, O
which O
demonstrated O
no O
findings O
suggestive O
of O
metastatic O

. O

Her O
pathology O
report O
was O
as O
follows O
: O

1. O
mesenteric O

MRA O
/ O
MRI O
revealed O
a O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
aneurysm O
about O
7 O
mm. O
in O
width O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
Fairm B-HOSPITAL
of I-HOSPITAL
Ijordcompmac I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
where O
a O
four O
vessel O
cerebral O
angiogram O
was O
performed O
on O
01/13 B-DATE
92 O
. O

This O
revealed O
a O
lobulated O
aneurysm O
at O
the O
p. O
comm. O
origin O
on O
the O
left O
. O

This O
was O
a O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
aneurysm O
. O

The O
internal O
carotid O
arteries O
and O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
showed O
irregularity O
of O
caliber O
probably O
due O
to O
atherosclerosis O
. O

After O
much O
discussion O
, O
endovascular O
treatment O
with O
GD O
coils O
were O
recommended O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
coiling O
on O
01/14 B-DATE
92 O
. O

This O
showed O
that O
60-70% O
of O
the O
distal O
aneurysm O
was O
obliterated O
by O
the O
coils O
. O

One O
coil O
protruded O
into O
the O
lumen O
of O
the O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
aneurysm O
. O

It O
was O
thought O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
subarachnoid O
hemorrhage O
was O
low O
but O
still O
substantial O
from O
the O
untreated O
proximal O
lobe O
. O

Also O
the O
risk O
of O
ischemia O
or O
infarct O
from O
the O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
coil O
could O
lead O
to O
thromboembolism O
. O

Therefore O
the O
lowest O
overall O
risk O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
craniotomy O
to O
obliterate O
the O
aneurysm O
and O
possibly O
remove O
the O
protruding O
coil O
. O

Therefore O
after O
discussion O
in O
detail O
with O
Sister O
Rora B-PATIENT
Dose I-PATIENT
, O
a O
left O
pterional O
craniotomy O
was O
performed O
on O
01/15 B-DATE
92 O
. O

At O
this O
time O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
the O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
aneurysm O
was O
mostly O
within O
the O
cavernous O
sinus O
and O
the O
extracavernous O
portion O
was O
extremely O
atherosclerotic O
. O

Therefore O
no O
clip O
was O
possible O
and O
the O
patient O
underwent O
a O
muslin O
wrapping O
of O
the O
aneurysm O
. O

The O
patient O
postoperatively O
was O
able O
to O
open O
her O
eyes O
to O
voice O
and O
name O
. O

Her O
pupils O
were O
equal O
and O
reactive O
and O
she O
was O
able O
to O
localize O
with O
the O
left O
upper O
extremity O
as O
well O
as O
raise O
the O
right O
upper O
extremity O
above O
the O
bed O
. O

Her O
consciousness O
as O
well O
as O
her O
strength O
improved O
gradually O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
referred O
for O
rehabilitation O
at O
a O
chronic O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
underwent O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
which O
revealed O
a O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
of O
11 O
, O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure O
of O
55/25 O
, O
pulmonary O

is O
an O
83 O
year O
old O
man O
with O
chronic O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
, O
mitral O
regurgitation O
and O
aortic O

who O
was O
admitted O
for O
diagnostic O
cardiac O
catheterization O
. O

Over O
the O
last O
four O
to O
five O
months O
, O
Mr. O
Warm B-PATIENT
has O
noted O
a O
marked O
decline O
in O
functional O
capacity O
with O
nearly O
daily O
PND O
and O
orthopnea O
. O

He O
has O
not O
experienced O
recent O
syncope O
but O
did O
have O
a O
syncopal O
episode O
in O
1 B-LOCATION
resulting O
in O
implantation O
of O
a O
defibrillator O
. O

Although O
in O
the O
past O
, O
he O
has O
been O
somewhat O
ambivalent O
with O
respect O
to O
cardiac O
surgery O
, O
given O
the O
decline O
in O
his O
functional O
capacity O
, O
he O
agreed O
to O
undergo O
repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization O
with O
a O
view O
towards O
defining O
his O
candidacy O
for O
cardiac O
surgery O
. O

The O
patient O
lives O
independently O
with O
his O
wife O
in O
Connecticut B-LOCATION
and O
continues O
to O
be O
less O
and O
less O
active O
unfortunately O
. O

He O
has O
nearly O
curtailed O
his O
trips O
to O
a O
gymnasium O
for O
cardiopulmonary O
exercising O
. O

He O
does O
not O
drink O
alcohol O
and O
does O
not O
smoke O
cigarettes O
. O

gallop O
at O
the O
apex O
and O
a O
2/6 O
murmur O
of O
mitral O
regurgitation O
at O
the O
apex O
which O
radiated O
to O
the O
axilla O
. O

The O
abdomen O
was O
soft O
and O

in O
the O
left O
circumflex O
artery O
and O
only O
minimal O
irregularities O
in O
the O
left O

. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
apart O
from O
a O
small O
rise O
in O
his O
creatinine O
to O
2.3 O
which O
returned O
to O
his O
baseline O
value O
of O
approximately O
1.7 O
to O
1.9 O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
after O
holding O
his O
diuretics O
and O
his O
vasodilator O
medications O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Win B-DOCTOR

, O
Dr. O
Shufffyfe B-DOCTOR
and O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
defer O
cardiac O
surgery O
likely O
indefinitely O
and O
probably O
permanently O
given O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
age O
, O
co-morbidities O
, O
lack O
of O
probable O
benefit O
with O
relief O
of O
his O
mitral O
regurgitation O
, O
modest O
aortic O
stenosis O
and O
relatively O
modest O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
. O

While O
in O
hospital O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
Lenni B-DOCTOR
Breutzoln I-DOCTOR
who O
felt O
that O
the O
incremental O
benefit O
from O
biventricular O
pacing O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
modest O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
underwent O
a O
sleep O
study O
which O
revealed O
evidence O
for O
fairly O
advanced O
and O
severe O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O
with O
multiple O
hypopneas O
and O
apneas O
, O
mean O
duration O
of O
which O
was O
approximately O
30 O
seconds O
with O
one O
episodes O
of O
68 O
seconds O
with O
a O
desaturation O
to O
71% O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
fitted O
with O
a O
CPAP O
apparatus O
with O
titration O
of O
8-12 O
cms. O
of O
water O
as O
tolerated O
as O
an O
outpatient O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
oxygen O
therapy O
given O
his O
prominent O
desaturation O
at O
night O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
vasodilator O
regimen O
had O
been O
winnowed O
appreciably O
and O
he O
was O
discharged O
with O
a O
goal O
weight O
of O
125 O
lbs O
. O

He O
will O
be O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Hospital O
and O
underwent O
an O
approximate O
1.5 O
liter O
diuresis O
within O
the O
first O
24 O
hours O
with O
improvement O
in O
his O
symptoms O
and O
improvement O
in O
his O
oxygen O
saturations O
. O

After O
a O
long O
discussion O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
family O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
would O
be O
prudent O
. O

Prior O
to O
catheterization O
a O
VQ O
scan O
was O
performed O
which O
revealed O
a O
moderate O
probability O
for O
PE O
with O
a O
subsegmental O
defect O
in O
the O
lingular O
on O
the O
left O
lung O
. O

Subsequent O
lower O
extremities O
noninvasive O
studies O
and O
D-dimer O
test O
were O
both O
negative O
rendering O
the O
probability O
of O
acute O
pulmonary O
embolism O
less O
than O
2 O
percent O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
be O
in O
need O
of O
chronic O
Coumadin O
therapy O
in O
lieu O
of O
this O
low O
probability O
findings O
in O
toto O
. O

Coronary O
angiography O
revealed O
occlusion O
of O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
proximally O
with O
insignificant O
plaquing O
in O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
artery O
and O
circumflex O
arteries O
. O

After O
a O
approximate O
3 O
liter O
total O
diuresis O
the O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
was O
5 O
, O
pulmonary O
capillary O
wedge O
pressure O
14 O
, O
pulmonary O
vacuolar O
resistance O
353 O
and O
the O
cardiac O
output O
depressed O
at O
2.95 O
liters O
per O
minute O
, O
or O
a O
cardiac O
index O
of O
1.7 O
liters O
per O
minute O
. O

Based O
upon O
these O
findings O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
Mr. O
State B-PATIENT
most O
likely O
has O
multi-factorial O
dyspnea O
owing O
to O
both O
his O
ventilatory O
limitation O
and O
to O
a O
chronic O
low O
output O
state O
. O

In O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Hospital O
and O
underwent O
an O
approximate O
1.5 O
liter O
diuresis O
within O
the O
first O
24 O
hours O
with O
improvement O
in O
his O
symptoms O
and O
improvement O
in O
his O
oxygen O
saturations O
. O

After O
a O
long O
discussion O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
family O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
would O
be O
prudent O
. O

Prior O
to O
catheterization O
a O
VQ O
scan O
was O
performed O
which O
revealed O
a O
moderate O
probability O
for O
PE O
with O
a O
subsegmental O
defect O
in O
the O
lingular O
on O
the O
left O
lung O
. O

Subsequent O
lower O
extremities O
noninvasive O
studies O
and O
D-dimer O
test O
were O
both O
negative O
rendering O
the O
probability O
of O
acute O
pulmonary O
embolism O
less O
than O
2 O
percent O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
be O
in O
need O
of O
chronic O
Coumadin O
therapy O
in O
lieu O
of O
this O
low O
probability O
findings O
in O
toto O
. O

Coronary O
angiography O
revealed O
occlusion O
of O
the O
right O

artery O
proximally O
with O
insignificant O
plaquing O
in O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O

and O
circumflex O
arteries O
. O

After O
a O
approximate O
3 O
liter O
total O
diuresis O
the O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
was O
5 O
, O
pulmonary O
capillary O

14 O
, O
pulmonary O

, O
or O
a O
cardiac O
index O
of O
1.7 O
liters O
per O
minute O
. O

Based O
upon O
these O
findings O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
Mr. O
Bridge B-PATIENT
most O
likely O
has O
multi-factorial O
dyspnea O
owing O
to O
both O
his O
ventilatory O
limitation O
and O
to O
a O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
her O

had O
showed O
no O
significant O
coronary O

, O
as O
well O
as O
intravenous O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
initial O
procedure O
well O
. O

On O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
however O
, O
a O
computerized O

scan O
revealed O
recurrent O
hemorrhage O
with O
obliteration O
of O
her O

. O

She O
was O
awake O
and O
following O
commands O
. O

It O
was O
necessary O
, O
however O
, O
to O
return O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
for O
re-evacuation O
of O
her O
hematoma O
, O
which O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
postoperative O
course O
was O
remarkably O
benign O
given O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
age O
and O
past O
medical O
history O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
extubated O
on O
the O
fifth O
postoperative O
day O
. O

She O
did O
develop O
some O
respiratory O
distress O
on O
the O
first O
day O
post-extubation O
, O
requiring O
48 O
hours O
of O
re-intubation O
. O

Her O
subsequent O
course O
from O
a O
respiratory O
standpoint O
has O
been O
relatively O
unremarkable O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
done O
very O
well O
from O
a O
neurological O
standpoint O

She O
is O
very O
bright O
, O
alert O
and O
oriented O
x O
three O
with O
an O
essentially O
normal O
neurological O
examination O

She O
has O
been O
tolerating O
a O
regular O

and O
has O
been O
working O
with O
physical O
therapy O
towards O
ambulation O
. O

On O
10-28 B-DATE
93 O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
development O
of O
a O
left O
lower O

deep O
venous O
thrombosis O
. O

She O
had O
been O
maintained O
on O
subcutaneous O
heparin O

initially O
postoperatively O
and O
developed O
her O

in O
this O
setting O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
, O
she O
has O
been O
maintained O
on O
bedrest O
and O
Coumadinized O
. O

Her O
current O
prothrombin O
time O
on O
11-3 B-DATE
93 O
was O
14.8 O
and O
it O
is O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
begin O
to O
be O
mobilized O
to O
a O

. O

Her O
prothrombin O

should O
be O
followed O
in O

maintain O
it O
at O
the O

of O
14-16 O

The O
patient O
overall O
has O
done O
very O
well O

. O

This O
was O
accompanied O
by O
substantial O

, O
she O
seemed O

, O
but O
generally O
alert O
, O
responsive O
, O
interactive O
, O
able O
to O
talk O
in O
two O
to O
three O

when O
she O
wants O

. O

She O
has O
severe O
memory O

, O
but O
nevertheless O
, O
is O
able O
to O
engage O
in O

, O
names O
things O
well O
, O
does O

. O

She O
has O
been O
working O
with O
Speech O
Therapy O
, O
occupational O
therapy O
and O
physical O
therapy O
closely O
and O
should O
continue O
to O
show O
improvement O
. O

She O
is O
anticoagulated O
on O
Coumadin O
and O
this O
has O
been O
stable O
. O

She O
is O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
wishes O
of O
her O
multiple O
family O

, O
left O
thalamus O
, O
bilateral O

. O

The O
patient O
had O
fevers O
sporadically O
during O
this O
hospitalization O
with O
rising O
white O
blood O
counts O
. O

A O
chest O
X-ray O
documented O
a O
progressing O
left O
lower O
lobe O
infiltrate O
. O

Initially O
this O
improved O
on O
Clindamycin O
and O
Cefotetan O
, O
but O
fevers O
recurred O
on O
this O
antibiotic O
regimen O
. O

Sputum O
grew O
out O
Klebsiella O
pneumoniae O
, O
and O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
Gentamicin O
and O
Ancef O
for O
14 O
days O
intravenous O
( O
bug O
being O
sensitive O
to O
these O
two O
drugs O
) O
. O

A O
left O
pleural O
effusion O
developed O
and O
this O
was O
tapped O
with O
ultrasound O
guidance O
, O
and O
found O
to O
be O
sterile O
, O
and O
without O
evidence O
of O
empyema O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
on O
Ciprofloxacin O
. O

The O
day O
of O
discharge O
is O
day O
#3 O
of O
7 O
, O
after O
which O
antibiotics O
should O
be O
totally O
discontinued O
. O

She O
has O
developed O
bad O
thrush O
in O
this O
setting O
, O
she O
is O
not O
yet O
able O
to O
swallow O
and O
so O
she O
is O
on O
Nystatin O
swish O
and O
spit O
five O
times O
a O
day O
. O

She O
also O
gets O
Peridex O
to O
clean O
out O
her O
mouth O
. O

Once O
her O
liver O
enzymes O
are O
completely O
normal O
, O
a O
seven O
day O
course O
of O
Fluconazol O
may O
be O
helpful O
if O
the O
thrush O
is O
not O
spontaneously O
resolving O
off O
of O
antibiotics O
. O

She O
has O
been O
afebrile O
for O
greater O
than O
10 O
days O
, O
including O
several O
days O
on O
oral O
antibiotics O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
liver O
enzymes O
were O
noted O
to O
be O
elevated O
mid O
way O
through O
her O
hospital O
course O
, O
to O
about O
three O
times O
normal O
, O
especially O
the O
SGOT O
and O
SGPT O
. O

These O
have O
spontaneously O
reversed O
, O
and O
are O
nearly O
normal O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

A O
right O
upper O
quadrant O
ultrasound O
documented O
gallstones O
, O
without O
evidence O
of O
common O
bile O
duct O
dilatation O
or O
active O
cholecystitis O
. O

The O
exact O
cause O
of O
her O
liver O
enzyme O
elevation O
is O
unclear O
, O
but O
we O
are O
being O
careful O
about O
administering O
drugs O
, O
which O
might O
irritate O
the O
liver O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
steady O
decline O
in O
her O
hematocrit O
during O
this O
hospitalization O
. O

Iron O
studies O
are O
all O
entirely O
normal O
, O
her O
anemia O
is O
attributed O
to O
anemia O
or O
chronic O
disease O
with O
hypoproliferation O
as O
well O
as O
multiple O
phlebotomies O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
give O
her O
folic O
acid O
, O
but O
not O
iron O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
potassiums O
have O
been O
repeatedly O
low O
and O
require O
daily O
checks O
and O
repletion O
. O

This O
is O
thought O
due O
to O
the O
extensive O
course O
of O
Gentamicin O
which O
she O
received O
. O

This O
must O
be O
carefully O
checked O
despite O
the O
standing O
order O
for O
potassium O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
low O
sodiums O
during O
this O
hospitalization O
. O

This O
may O
due O
to O
her O
central O
nervous O
system O
process O
or O
her O
pulmonary O
process O
, O
with O
fluids O
administered O
as O
described O
, O
she O
should O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
from O
this O
. O

Her O
sodiums O
were O
never O
below O
130 O
. O

She O
does O
well O
with O
tube O
feeds O
. O

Her O
tube O
feeds O
orders O
are O
as O
follow O
: O

full O
strength O
Replete O
with O
fiber O
at O
70 O
cc. O
per O
hour O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
gets O
250 O
cc. O
of O
juice O
( O
not O
water O
) O
three O
times O
a O
day O
. O

She O
also O
gets O
Lactinex O
granules O
three O
packages O
in O
each O
bottle O
of O
tube O
feeds O
. O

She O
also O
gets O
Metamucil O
one O
teaspoon O
with O
the O
first O
bolus O
of O
juice O
each O
day O
. O

Please O
note O
that O
evaluation O
by O
the O
swallowing O
therapist O
, O
showed O
that O
the O
patient O
is O
aspirating O
at O
this O
time O
, O
but O
there O
is O
great O
hope O
from O
the O
nature O
of O
her O
deficit O
and O
the O
good O
movements O
of O
her O
tongue O
that O
normal O
swallowing O
should O
return O
soon O
. O

It O
is O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
she O
is O
discharged O
with O
an O
nasogastric O
tube O
and O
that O
no O
plans O
for O
G O
tube O
placement O
are O
made O
at O
this O
time O
. O

She O
has O
a O
history O
of O
of O
angina O
without O
myocardial O
infarction O
that O
has O
not O
been O
worked O
up O
. O

She O
did O
have O
brief O
chest O
pain O
twice O
during O
this O
admission O
that O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
electrocardiogram O
changes O
. O

In O
the O
first O
week O
of O
November B-DATE
, O
her O
electrocardiogram O
showed O
T O
wave O
inversions O
in O
the O
lateral O
leads O
, O
correlating O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
LDH O
, O
but O
not O
CK O
. O

This O
did O
not O
normalize O
with O
administration O
of O
Isordil O
and O
the O
patient O
denied O
chest O
pain O
at O
this O
time O
. O

As O
of O
5/9 B-DATE
, O
her O
electrocardiogram O
had O
reverted O
back O
to O
normal O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
or O
continued O
electrocardiogram O
changes O
, O
and O
chest O
pain O
is O
absent O
. O

Her O
cholesterol O
was O
350 O
here O
. O

She O
has O
been O
off O
of O
her O
hypercholesterol O
medicines O
. O

These O
can O
be O
restarted O
when O
it O
is O
deemed O
reasonable O
, O
in O
view O
of O
her O
acute O
disease O
and O
recently O

Note O
that O
the O
liver O

The O
patient O
was O
extremely O
reluctant O
to O
undergo O

he O
understands O
that O
this O
may O
become O
necessary O
in O
the O

. O

Dr. O
Amesin B-DOCTOR
had O
a O
long O

his O
medicines O
and O
smoked O
heavily O
on O
the O

and O
not O
kept O
any O
of O
his O

. O

The O
importance O
of O
quitting O
smoking O
as O
well O
as O
continuing O
to O
follow O
his O
medical O
regimen O
was O
emphasized O
to O
the O
daughter O
and O
to O
the O
patient O
. O

She O
will O
be O
actively O
involved O
in O
encouraging O
the O
patient O
to O
comply O
with O
this O
medical O
regimen O
and O
also O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
Dr. O
Amesin B-DOCTOR
as O
well O
as O
Dr. O
Lfsquarc B-DOCTOR
on O
the O
outside O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
guaiac O
negative O
throughout O
the O
entire O
hospitalization O
. O

Despite O
being O
on O
heparin O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
his O
hematocrit O
remained O
very O
stable O
with O
only O
a O
small O
dip O
after O
the O
catheterization O
was O
done O
. O

He O
will O
need O
to O
be O
followed O
up O
as O
an O
out O
patient O
for O
guaiac O
positive O

and O
possibly O
worked O
up O
for O

. O

Once O
on O
the O

the O
patient O
had O
no O
recurrent O
chest O

felt O
that O
, O
given O
the O

, O
he O
could O
undergo O
flexible O
sigmoidoscopy O
electively O
at O
some O

. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
exercise O
stress O
testing O
with O

heart O
rate O
on O
the O
modified O
Bruce O
protocol O
. O

He O
did O
not O
have O
chest O
pain O
. O

There O
were O
ST O

abnormalities O
with O
2.5 O
mm O
horizontal O
depressions O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
3 O
minutes O
of O
exercise O
, O
which O
persisted O
into O

. O

The O
thallium O
images O
showed O
fixed O
anterior O

septal O
wall O
defects O
without O
any O
definite O
evidence O
of O
redistribution O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
data O
, O
on O
the O
tenth O
hospital O

the O
patient O
underwent O
repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization O
which O
demonstrated O
a O

and O
a O
distal O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
lesion O
with O
a O
tight O
stenosis O
and O
a O
small O

. O

These O
findings O
were O
considered O
not O
to O
be O
hemodynamically O
significant O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
therefore O
to O
be O
discharged O
on O
medical O
therapy O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
and O
he O
was O
started O
on O
chemotherapy O
and O
radiation O
therapy O
to O
the O
L4 O
spine O
region O
. O

The O
first O
course O
of O
chemotherapy O
was O
given O
from O
8-19 B-DATE
93 O
through O
8-21 B-DATE
93 O
. O

This O
was O
VP-16 O
150 O
mg O
daily O
x O
three O
and O
cisplatin O
60 O
mg O
daily O
x O
three O
with O
Zofran O
11 O
mg O
on O
three O
occasions O
as O
an O
antiemetic O
and O
each O
dose O
of O
cisplatin O
was O
preceded O
by O
12.5 O
grams O
of O
Decadron O
. O

The O
chemotherapy O
was O
well O
tolerated O
but O
did O
result O
in O
febrile O
neutropenia O
. O

Granulocyte O
colony O
stimulating O
factor O
was O
added O
. O

Thus O
white O
blood O
count O
dropped O
to O
0.6 O
minimum O
on O
8-27 B-DATE
, O
with O
platelet O
count O
of O
63,000 O
but O
with O
granulocyte O
colony O
stimulating O
factor O
support O
and O
antibiotics O
for O
febrile O
neutropenia O
, O
white O
blood O
count O
recovered O
. O

Actually O
the O
lowest O
white O
blood O
count O
was O
0.5 O
on O
8-31 B-DATE
93 O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
, O
platelet O
count O
was O
as O
low O
as O
17,000 O
. O

By O
9-8 B-DATE
93 O
, O
the O
white O
blood O
count O
was O
back O
up O
to O
16.2 O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
severe O
pain O
and O
intractable O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
severe O
substernal O
pain O
. O

He O
is O
on O
MS O
Contin O
and O
also O
on O
Duragesic O
patch O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
have O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Signs B-DOCTOR
of O
Gastroenterology O
. O

Eventually O
, O
a O
PICC O
line O
was O
inserted O
and O
he O
was O
given O
central O
total O
parenteral O
nutrition O
because O
of O
severe O
anorexia O
during O
radiation O
therapy O
. O

Two O
weeks O
passed O
without O
a O
bowel O
movement O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
intake O
and O
eventually O
that O
resolved O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
endoscopy O
would O
be O
of O
value O
. O

A O
central O
venous O
line O
was O
placed O
on O
8-29 B-DATE
93 O
. O

After O
neutropenia O
resolved O
by O
9-2 B-DATE
93 O
with O
white O
blood O
count O
rising O
to O
2.2 O
and O
platelet O
count O
to O
28,000 O
, O
endoscopy O
became O
feasible O
. O

This O
was O
done O
on O
9-4 B-DATE
93 O
and O
there O
were O
inflammatory O
exudates O
, O
ulcerations O
, O
and O
granulation O
tissue O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
distal O
third O
of O
the O
esophagus O
, O
but O
the O
tumor O
polypoid O
masses O
had O
completely O
disappeared O
. O

Cytologic O
brushings O
of O
the O
ulcerated O
areas O
were O
positive O
for O
cancer O
cells O
but O
deep O
biopsies O
were O
negative O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
fluconazole O
in O
case O
there O
was O
any O
Monilia O
, O
although O
biopsy O
did O
not O
confirm O
the O
presence O
of O
Monilia O
. O

Gradually O
during O
the O
hospitalization O
, O
the O
sternal O
pain O
improved O
, O
as O
did O
the O
pain O
in O
the O
left O
hip O
and O
the O
patient O
became O
able O
to O
ambulate O
somewhat O
. O

He O
was O
making O
progress O
and O
accordingly O
, O
a O
second O
course O
of O
chemotherapy O
was O
given O
at O
lower O
dose O
. O

He O
received O
VP-16 O
100 O
mg O
daily O
x O
three O
, O
9-12 B-DATE
, O
9-13 B-DATE
and O
9-14 B-DATE
93 O
, O
and O
cisplatin O
40 O
mg O
daily O
x O
three O
on O
that O
same O
date O
with O
Zofran O
10 O
mg. O

The O
only O
problem O
was O
some O
recurrent O
nausea O
. O

The O
radiation O
therapy O
was O
finally O
finished O
on O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
, O
9-19 B-DATE
93 O
, O
at O
which O
point O
the O
patient O
was O
able O
to O
take O
fluids O
and O
food O
but O
was O
still O
occasionally O
vomiting O
. O

His O
white O
blood O
count O
was O
in O
the O
range O
of O
53,000 O
because O
Neupogen O
had O
been O
started O
with O
his O
second O
cycle O
of O
chemotherapy O
and O
will O
be O
continued O
until O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
he O
has O
passed O
the O
nadir O
of O
any O
neutropenia O
to O
be O
expected O
from O
this O
cycle O
of O
chemotherapy O
. O

. O

His O
chest O
showed O
bilateral O
rhonchi O
. O

The O
abdomen O
was O
distended O
with O
active O
bowel O
sounds O
. O

The O
rectal O

. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Wire B-DOCTOR
who O
felt O
that O
manipulation O
of O
the O
tracheal O
tube O
was O
the O
best O
approach O
to O
the O
air O
leak O
since O
it O
was O
a O
new O
trach O
and O
he O
was O
requiring O
such O
high O
ventilator O
support O
that O
it O
was O
risky O
to O
change O
it O
. O

He O
also O
felt O
that O
lung O
biopsy O
at O
this O
time O
was O
rather O
risky O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
therefore O
completely O
cultured O
again O
and O
begun O
on O
antibiotic O
coverage O
which O
would O
take O
care O
of O
the O
Pseudomonas O
he O
was O
known O
to O
have O
. O

The O
steroids O
were O
tapered O
. O

He O
was O
also O
begun O
on O
anti-Candida O
regimen O
for O
his O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
with O
yeast O
being O
seen O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
story O
of O
hemoptysis O
, O
he O
also O
underwent O
an O
exotic O
bleeding O
work O
up O
for O
such O
things O
as O
Wegner O
&apos;s O
and O
Goodpasture O
&apos;s O
. O

These O
results O
were O
all O
negative O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
require O
very O
high O
FIO2 O
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
DVT O
by O
ultrasound O
. O

He O
underwent O
a O
trial O
of O
TPA O
followed O
by O
heparin O
. O

This O
produced O
substantially O
further O
hemoptysis O
and O
the O
need O
for O
transfusion O
. O

He O
stabilized O
from O
this O
, O
but O
on O
the O
fifth O
while O
continuing O
to O
have O
extremely O
ventilator O
requirement O
. O

In O
consultation O
with O
his O
family O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
enough O
support O
had O
been O
done O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
therefore O
, O
ventilator O
support O
was O
withdrawn O
under O
the O
comfort O
measures O
of O
morphine O
. O

C4-C6 O
vertebrae O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
threatening O
the O

The O
biopsy O
was O
consistent O
with O
poorly-differentiated O

, O
thought O
to O
be O
lung O
primary O
, O
given O
his O
chest O

. O

Mr. O
Days B-PATIENT
subsequently O
underwent O

spine O
for O
palliation O
. O

Bone-scan O
and O
abdominal O
computerized O

in O
the O
ribs O
, O
cervical O
, O
and O
lumbar O
spine O
, O

. O

In O
December B-DATE
1993 O
, O
Mr. O
Days B-PATIENT
underwent O
brachiotherapy O
of O
his O
right O
upper O

Mr. O
Days B-PATIENT
has O
also O
developed O
a O

thought O
secondary O
to O
probable O
bone O

He O
also O
has O
apparently O
developed O
a O
mild-moderate O
persistent O
leukocytosis O
over O

. O

He O
also O
developed O
rather O
regular O
night O

which O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O

There O
was O
concern O
over O
his O
sleep O

but O
he O
appeared O
to O
have O
primarily O
cardiac O
disease O
and O
therefore O
because O

it O
was O

. O

On O
June B-DATE

, O
1993 O
, O
Dr. O
Lenni B-DOCTOR
Breutzoln I-DOCTOR
performed O
triple O
coronary O

. O

He O
placed O
a O
left O
internal O

graft O
to O
the O
left O

single O
saphenous O

a O

to O
the O

with O
140 O
cc. O

. O

He O
weaned O
easily O
off O
cardiopulmonary O
bypass O
. O

He O
had O
no O
hemodynamic O
difficulties O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
wean O
from O
the O
ventilator O
, O
but O
he O
did O
have O
marginal O
oxygenation O
throughout O
. O

He O
did O
revert O
back O
to O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

He O
was O
extubated O
within O
forty O
eight O
hours O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
out O
of O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
on O
June B-DATE
26 I-DATE
. O

He O
reverted O
back O
to O
atrial O
fibrillation O
that O
required O
Digoxin O
, O
and O
Verapamil O
to O
control O
. O

He O
could O
not O
be O
converted O
back O
to O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
even O
with O
a O
trial O
of O
Quinaglute O
. O

He O
also O
had O
anemia O
and O
he O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Nutrition O
Service O
. O

He O
was O
advised O
to O
have O
an O
ideal O
body O
weight O
of O
178 O
pounds O
, O
and O
clearly O
a O
2300 O
calorie O
diet O
was O
appropriate O
for O
him O
. O

Weight O
reduction O
would O
be O
important O
in O
the O
long O
term O
management O
of O
his O
coronary O
disease O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
Digoxin O
and O
Diuretics O
along O
with O
Ace O
inhibitors O
because O
of O
his O
depressed O
left O
ventricular O
function O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
ambulate O
although O
somewhat O
slowly O
because O
of O
his O
rapid O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

It O
was O
considered O
to O
obtain O
a O
pulmonary O
consultation O
on O
a O
formal O
basis O
, O
but O
it O
was O
then O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
do O
better O
by O
healing O
fully O
from O
his O
surgery O
, O
because O
he O
really O
had O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
pulmonary O
complications O
, O
despite O
the O
history O
of O
sleep O
apnea O
of O
an O
obstructive O
basis O
. O

Primary O
in O
his O
long O
term O
management O
is O
cardiac O
rehabilitation O
with O
weight O
reduction O
. O

A O
modified O
upper O
GI O
x-ray O
series O
was O
obtained O
, O
which O
revealed O
malpositioning O
of O
the O
duodenum O
and O
jejunum O
in O
the O
right O
abdomen O
, O
consistent O
with O
intestinal O
malrotation O
, O
but O
no O
evidence O
of O
obstruction O
in O
the O
duodenum O
or O
jejunum O
was O
identified O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
prevented O
from O
taking O
anything O
by O
mouth O
and O
endoscopic O
retrograde O
cholangiopancreatography O
was O
performed O
. O

This O
study O
identified O
a O
5 O
centimeter O
narrowed O
segment O
in O
the O
distal O
common O
bile O
duct O
, O
and O
moderately O
severe O
dilatation O
of O
the O
left O
biliary O
radicals O
in O
the O
right O
hepatic O
duct O
. O

A O
temporary O
stent O
was O
placed O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
function O
well O
despite O
its O
unsatisfactory O
positioning O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
complications O
. O

He O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Ward O
in O
stable O
condition O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
probable O
malignant O
nature O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
biliary O
obstruction O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
GI O
lab O
on O
11/25 B-DATE
93 O
, O
where O
repeat O
endoscopic O
retrograde O
cholangiopancreatography O
was O
performed O
. O

This O
procedure O
was O
performed O
under O
general O
anesthesia O
, O
and O
resulted O
in O
successful O
placement O
of O
a O
permanent O
stent O
within O
the O
distal O
common O
bile O
duct O
. O

Additionally O
, O
a O
computer O
tomography O
guided O
needle O
biopsy O
was O
performed O
of O
the O
paraportal O
mass O
. O

These O
procedures O
were O
well O
tolerated O
by O
the O
patient O
, O
and O
were O
free O
of O
complication O
. O

As O
before O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
covered O
with O
post-procedure O
antibiotic O
therapy O

were O
both O
positive O
for O
malignant O

Because O
of O
the O
intense O
diffuse O
inflammatory O
reaction O
that O

coronary O
artery O
. O

This O
operation O
was O
performed O
by O
Dr. O
Chitllik B-DOCTOR
Kote I-DOCTOR
. O

Intraoperative O
findings O
were O
as O
follows O
: O

The O
pericardium O
was O
opened O
to O
reveal O
a O
heart O
that O
appeared O
essentially O
normal O
. O

The O
diagonal O
coronary O
artery O
was O
isolated O
, O
opened O
and O
probed O
with O
a O
1.5 O
millimeter O
probe O
. O

The O
circumflex O
marginal O
artery O
was O
small O
and O
only O
took O
a O
1 O
millimeter O
probe O
tightly O
. O

The O
first O
main O
was O
anastomosed O
side O
to O
side O
to O
the O
diagonal O
and O
end O
to O
end O
to O
the O
circumflex O
marginal O
artery O
. O

The O
left O
anterior O
descending O
artery O
was O
then O
isolated O
, O
opened O
, O
probed O
with O
a O
1.5 O
millimeter O
probe O
and O
anastomosed O
to O
the O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
. O

The O
acute O
marginal O
branch O
of O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
was O
isolated O
, O
opened O
and O
probed O
with O
a O
1.5 O
millimeter O
probe O
tightly O
and O
a O
second O
main O
was O
anastomosed O
to O
this O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
and O
was O
transported O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
in O
stable O
condition O
on O
nitroglycerin O
at O
50 O
mcg. O

and O
transported O
to O
the O
routine O
postoperative O
care O
floor O
on O

condition O
. O

The O
only O
issue O
of O
note O
during O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
SICU O
course O
was O
a O
small O
right O
apical O
pneumothorax O
which O
disappeared O
on O
repeat O

x-ray O
. O

The O
other O
issue O
was O
that O
the O
Pacer O
Lab O
was O
consulted O
for O
an O
atrial O
sensing O
problem O
. O

The O
pace O
setter O

Synchrony O
II O
was O
interrogated O
. O

It O
was O
found O
to O
have O
inadequate O
atrial O
sensing O
, O
even O
post O
re-programming O
to O
the O
maximum O
sensitivity O
at O
0.5 O
millivolts O
. O

The O
V O
sensor O
was O
changed O
from O
4 O
millivolts O
to O

. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
atrial O
pacing O
would O
improve O
as O
the O
edema O
resolved O
. O

perform O
reduction O
pneumoplasty O
. O

This O
proceeded O
uneventfully O
. O

She O
was O
extubated O
and O
stable O
with O
a O
good O
airway O
and O
good O
oxygen O
saturation O
. O

However O
, O
upon O
transferring O
her O
from O
the O
operating O
room O
bed O
to O
the O
stretcher O
she O
had O
an O
arrest O
. O

This O
appeared O
to O
be O
respiratory O
in O
origin O
. O

She O
was O
placed O
back O
on O
the O
operating O
room O
table O
and O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
was O
begun O
. O

Pressors O
were O
given O
and O
she O
quickly O
responded O
with O
a O
return O
in O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
. O

Her O
blood O
pressure O
remained O
unstable O
requiring O
large O
amounts O
of O
pressors O
. O

X-rays O
showed O
no O
pneumothorax O
and O
there O
was O
no O
bleeding O
from O
her O
chest O
tubes O
. O

She O
was O
therefore O
transferred O
up O
to O
the O
Respiratory O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

Early O
in O
her O
postoperative O
course O
her O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressures O
were O
quite O
high O
, O
70/30 O
. O

Her O
wedge O
pressure O
was O
20 O
and O
there O
were O
no O
electrocardiogram O
changes O
. O

She O
ruled O
out O
for O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

She O
developed O
a O
picture O
consistent O
with O
right O
heart O
failure O
with O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
and O
require O
nitric O
oxide O
administration O
. O

This O
improved O
her O
right O
heart O
function O
with O
lower O
PA O
pressures O
. O

She O
developed O
a O
right O
pleural O
effusion O
which O
required O
chest O
tube O
placement O
to O
remove O
1200 O
ccs O
of O
straw-colored O
fluid O
. O

She O
remained O
fully O
ventilated O
with O
marginal O
hemodynamic O
status O
on O
Levophed O
, O
dobutamine O
and O
nitric O
oxide O
. O

Ultimately O
she O
was O
able O
to O
be O
weaned O
off O
of O
her O
Levophed O
as O
well O
as O
her O
nitric O
oxide O
. O

However O
, O
because O
of O
persistent O
episodes O
of O
right O
heart O
failure O
, O
dobutamine O
was O
started O
. O

This O
improved O
her O
cardiac O
function O
. O

She O
failed O
to O
wean O
from O
the O
ventilator O
and O
on O
2/14 B-DATE
94 O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
for O
a O
tracheostomy O
. O

She O
had O
a O
complicated O
course O
from O
an O
Infectious O
Disease O
standpoint O
with O
multiple O
positive O
cultures O
including O
sputum O
positive O
for O
Pseudomonas O
cepacia O
, O
blood O
cultures O
which O
were O
positive O
for O
Streptococcus O
milleri O
. O

The O
right O
pleural O
fluid O
was O
also O
positive O
for O
Streptococcus O
milleri O
. O

She O
had O
Citrobacter O
from O
her O
sinuses O
with O
evidence O
of O
sinusitis O
. O

She O
was O
treated O
with O
multiple O
courses O
of O
broad O
spectrum O
antibiotics O
. O

Given O
her O
protracted O
postoperative O
course O
the O

a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
80/56 O
and O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
124 O
. O

His O

. O

His O
cardiac O
exam O
was O
remarkable O
for O
a O
summation O
gallop O
. O

No O
murmur O
was O
auscultated O
but O
the O
high O
heart O
rate O
did O
diminish O
the O
possibility O
of O
this O
. O

His O
abdomen O
was O
soft O
and O
he O
had O
no O
extremity O
edema O
. O

His O

x-ray O
revealed O
mild O
pulmonary O
edema O
and O
cardiomegaly O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
it O
was O
hoped O
that O
his O
end O
organ O
dysfunction O
would O
improve O
with O
a O
period O
of O
ballooning O
and O
improved O
perfusion O
such O
as O
to O
allow O
transplantation O
to O
eventually O
take O
place O
. O

He O
was O
maintained O
on O
Levophed O
as O
a O
vasopressor O
as O
well O
as O
dopamine O
and O
dobutamine O
. O

It O
was O
noted O
that O
his O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
was O
only O
a O
30 O
ml O
pump O
, O
and O
on O
the O
day O
after O
admission O
, O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
was O
taken O
to O
the O
catheterization O
laboratory O
where O
this O
was O
exchanged O
for O
a O
40 O
ml O
pump O
. O

After O
replacement O
of O
the O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
, O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
remained O
critically O
ill O
, O
although O
there O
was O
some O
improvement O
in O
his O
augmented O
diastolic O
pressure O
. O

He O
did O
develop O
atrial O
fibrillation O
, O
however O
, O
which O
led O
to O
hemodynamic O
decompensation O
with O
a O
wedge O
pressure O
of O
32 O
and O
a O
cardiac O
index O
of O
1.6 O
. O

It O
was O
hoped O
that O
with O
continued O
inotropic O
support O
this O
would O
improve O
. O

He O
also O
remained O
intubated O
. O

Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
was O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Farstshuff B-DOCTOR
of O
the O
GI O
Service O
for O
advice O
regarding O
his O
Crohn O
&apos;s O
disease O
. O

All O
of O
these O
issues O
, O
including O
his O
acute O
renal O
failure O
, O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
contraindications O
to O
transplantation O
. O

As O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
did O
not O
have O
any O
bowel O
sounds O
, O
he O
did O
have O
to O
remain O
on O
nasogastric O
suction O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Needs B-DOCTOR
of O
the O
Renal O
Unit O
. O

Dr. O
Needs B-DOCTOR
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
had O
ischemic O
acute O
tubular O
necrosis O
and O
that O
we O
could O
continue O
to O
administer O
diuretics O
in O
a O
an O
effort O
to O
take O
off O
volume O
, O
but O
that O
we O
did O
have O
to O
allow O
time O
to O
pass O
in O
order O
to O
see O
improvement O
. O

Procainamide O
was O
begun O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
convert O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
to O
sinus O
rhythm O
from O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

Initially O
he O
was O
in O
and O
out O
of O
sinus O
rhythm O
, O
but O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
did O
occur O
frequently O
. O

As O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
renal O
function O
did O
not O
improve O
, O
he O
was O
begun O
on O
continuous O
venovenous O
hemodialysis O
. O

This O
resulted O
in O
a O
reasonable O
clearance O
of O
creatinine O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
get O
some O
fluid O
off O
as O
well O
. O

With O
getting O
some O
volume O
off O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
ventilation O
improved O
, O
as O
did O
many O
of O
his O
other O
metabolic O
parameters O
. O

His O
cardiac O
index O
had O
also O
improved O
with O
this O
to O
2.7 O
, O
although O
he O
was O
on O
dobutamine O
as O
well O
. O

On O
6/19 B-DATE
an O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
attempt O
to O
wean O
the O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
. O

With O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
counterpulsation O
ration O
, O
he O
developed O
atrial O
flutter O
with O
a O
fall O
in O
blood O
pressure O
and O
cardiac O
index O
. O

The O
balloon O
pump O
was O
restored O
. O

He O
was O
continued O
on O
this O
as O
well O
as O
on O
dobutamine O
and O
amrinone O
support O
. O

He O
continued O
on O
hemodialysis O
, O
but O
had O
little O
urine O
output O
. O

Supportive O
care O
continued O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
white O
blood O
count O
began O
rising O
, O
raising O
the O
possibility O
of O
sepsis O
. O

Broad O
spectrum O
antibiotics O
to O
cover O
potential O
sources O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
were O
begun O
and O
ciprofloxacin O
was O
added O
. O

Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
&apos;s O
blood O
pressure O
appeared O
to O
stabilize O
. O

Another O
effort O
was O
made O
on O
6/22 B-DATE
to O
attempt O
to O
wean O
the O
balloon O
, O
but O
this O
led O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
his O
wedge O
pressure O
and O
a O
fall O
in O
his O
arterial O
pressure O
, O
and O
this O
was O
stopped O
and O
he O
was O
restored O
to O
full O
counterpulsation O
. O

He O
had O
been O
able O
to O
be O
transiently O
extubated O
after O
dialysis O
had O
reduced O
his O
lung O
water O
, O
but O
he O
had O
to O
be O
reintubated O
on O
6/24 B-DATE
. O

Hemodialysis O
continued O
with O
maintenance O
of O
reasonable O
metabolic O
parameters O
. O

He O
did O
develop O
worsening O
metabolic O
acidosis O
. O

His O
hemodialysis O
was O
adjusted O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
resolve O
this O
. O

He O
continued O
on O
vancomycin O
, O
ciprofloxacin O
, O
Zosyn O
, O
and O
fluconazole O
antibiotics O
. O

Another O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
attempt O
to O
wean O
the O
intra-aortic O
balloon O
pump O
on O
6/26 B-DATE
. O

This O
resulted O
in O
a O
fall O
in O
his O
cardiac O
index O
, O
but O
his O
blood O
pressure O
and O
wedge O
pressure O
were O
stable O
. O

He O
did O
have O
runs O
of O
non-sustained O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
. O

On O
6/29 B-DATE
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
began O
developing O
periods O
of O
hypotension O
. O

The O
patient O
stated O
that O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
reintubated O
, O
as O
it O
became O
quite O
clear O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
a O
transplant O
candidate O
. O

He O
began O
having O
multiple O
runs O
of O
non-sustained O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
. O

The O
patient O
and O
his O
significant O
friend O
, O
Incloztaua B-PATIENT
, O
had O
a O
long O
discussion O
with O
his O
physicians O
and O
they O
felt O
that O
, O
given O
the O
futility O
of O
his O
situation O
, O
supportive O
care O
should O
be O
ended O
. O

Indicative O
of O
this O
, O
Mr. O
Given B-PATIENT
took O
his O
oxygen O
mask O
and O
demanded O
that O
it O
not O
be O
replaced O
. O

He O
developed O
progressive O
hypotension O
and O
was O
pronounced O
dead O
early O
on O

Prior O
to O
his O
admission O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
gunshot O
wound O
was O
sutured O
close O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
placed O
on O
suicide O
precautions O
, O
and O
was O
hydrated O
with O
an O
infusion O
of O
intravenous O
fluid O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Psychiatry O
Service O
, O
who O
began O
a O
battery O
of O
testing O
, O
which O
continues O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
Consulting O
Psychiatrist O
recommended O
a O
minimum O
of O
2 O
point O
restraints O
at O
all O
times O
, O
and O
recommended O
the O
patient O
be O
monitored O
by O
a O
sitter O
. O

Allowing O
the O
patient O
to O
ambulate O
was O
not O
recommended O
. O

From O
a O
medical O
standpoint O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
. O

He O
was O
initially O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurological O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
where O
he O
was O
closely O
monitored O
during O
the O
first O
two O
days O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
chief O
obstacle O
was O
bringing O
his O
blood O
pressure O
under O
control O
and O
this O
was O
ultimately O
achieved O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
Captopril O
and O
Nifedipine O
. O

After O
his O
blood O
pressure O
had O
stabilized O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Ward O
. O

Close O
monitoring O
demonstrated O
his O
blood O
pressure O
to O
be O
stable O
and O
within O
an O
acceptable O
rang O
on O
his O
dosage O
regimen O
. O

The O
Psychiatry O
Service O
followed O
up O
extensively O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
and O
his O
Psychiatric O
progress O
is O
detailed O
in O
the O
Psychiatry O
transfer O
note O
. O

By O
the O
7th O
hospital O
day O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
medically O
stable O
. O

He O
had O
undergone O
full O
Psychiatric O
evaluation O
, O
and O
was O
prepared O
for O
transfer O
to O
a O
Psychiatric O
Hospital O
. O

Therefore O
, O
because O
of O
his O
need O
for O
intense O
psychiatric O

, O
the O

is O

suspected O
a O
subclinical O
congestive O

, O
however O
on O
further O
elucidation O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O

IN O
SUMMARY O
: O

Ms. O
Abreun B-PATIENT
is O
a O
fifty O
nine-year-old O
female O
who O
presented O
with O
necrotizing O
fascitis O
of O
the O
right O
hip O
, O
status O
post O
debridement O
, O
severely O
debilitated O
by O
the O
extent O
of O
her O
infection O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
2 O
months O
this O
infection O
was O
cleared O
, O
the O
wound O
was O
cleaned O
and O
split O
thickness O
skin O
grafting O
was O
successful O
in O
covering O
over O
the O
wound O
. O

Her O
course O
, O
however O
was O
complicated O
by O
an O
methicillin O
resistant O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
pneumonia O
which O
was O
resistant O
to O
therapy O
and O
which O
produced O
a O
profound O
sepsis O
which O
caused O
a O
hypotensive O
ana O
apneic O
episode O
which O
required O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
support O
for O
a O
period O
of O
a O
week O
. O

Her O
course O
was O
also O
complicated O
by O
her O
hypoactive O
thyroid O
function O
which O
went O
unrecognized O
for O
some O
period O
, O
but O
has O
since O
resolved O
with O
aggressive O
Synthroid O
therapy O
. O

Currently O
, O
her O
most O
issues O
are O
the O
advancement O
of O
her O
tube O
feeds O
and O
the O
restarting O
of O
her O
PO O
intake O
which O
was O
planned O
to O
begin O
for O
the O
next O
several O
days O
before O
her O
transfer O
was O
initiated O
. O

Her O
wound O
also O
requires O
further O
care O
as O
smaller O
areas O

: O

The O

an O
85-year-old O
male O
who O
has O
had O
longstanding O

over O
the O

in O
because O
of O

, O
referred O
from O

Hospital I-HOSPITAL
. O

He O
had O
had O
previous O
studies O
including O
a O
computed O
axial O

scan O
which O
showed O
no O
pathology O
and O
they O
were O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
explain O
his O
diarrhea O
and O
dehydration O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
numerous O
studies O
here O
, O
all O
of O
which O
were O
negative O
including O
endoscopic O
assessment O
of O
his O
upper O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
and O
colonoscopy O
, O
both O
of O
which O
were O
normal O
. O

The O
patient O
seemed O
to O
settle O
down O
while O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
in O
fact O
started O
to O
have O
solid O
bowel O
movements O
and O
so O
on O
a O
controlled O
diet O
, O
which O
was O
purposely O
free O
of O
milk O
and O
milk O
products O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
discharged O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
his O
doctor O
, O
Dr. O
Both B-DOCTOR
at O
the O
Sonpathcermu B-HOSPITAL
Jords I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
but O
suffice O
it O
to O
say O
that O
no O
pathology O
was O
found O
in O
this O
hospital O
. O

He O
had O
widespread O
abdominal O
distention O
and O
for O
a O
while O
looked O
like O
he O
might O
have O
had O
ischemic O
problems O
with O
his O
sigmoid O
colon O
resulting O
in O
a O
functional O
large O
bowel O
obstruction O
but O
this O
cleared O
while O
he O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
he O
expelled O
large O
amounts O
of O
gas O
and O
decompressed O
his O
distention O
and O
his O
diarrhea O
stopped O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
much O
, O
much O
better O
. O

Whether O
this O
was O
related O
to O
medication O
, O
viral O
gastroenteritis O
or O
ischemic O
bowel O
problems O
is O
unclear O
, O
but O
he O
got O
better O
and O
went O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Cardiac O
Catheterization O
Laboratory O
. O

There O
, O
her O
pulmonary O
wedge O
pressure O
was O
12 O
and O
her O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
was O
4 O
and O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure O
44/17 O
. O

Her O
left O
ventricular O
contraction O
showed O
akinesis O
of O
the O
anterior O
wall O
with O
dyskinesis O
of O
the O
apex O
. O

She O
had O
preserved O
inferior O
contraction O
and O
basal O
contraction O
. O

Her O
native O
right O
and O
left O
anterior O
descending O
vessels O
were O
occluded O
as O
was O
an O
obtuse O
marginal O
branch O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
to O
the O
high O
diagonal O
or O
high O
obtuse O
marginal O
was O
occluded O
. O

The O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
to O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
was O
also O
occluded O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
the O
second O
obtuse O
marginal O
was O
open O
with O
no O
significant O
stenosis O
, O
but O
there O
was O
an O
outflow O
lesion O
in O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
2 O
as O
well O
as O
severe O
distal O
lesion O
as O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
2 O
fed O
the O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
. O

This O
was O
considered O
her O
culprit O
lesion O
. O

This O
was O
considered O
too O
high O
risk O
for O
angioplasty O
because O
of O
the O
severe O
disease O
in O
the O
graft O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
saphenous O
vein O
harvested O
from O
both O
thighs O
. O

Her O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
was O
also O
unused O
. O

It O
was O
also O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
failure O
to O
sense O
with O
the O
atrial O
lead O
. O

She O
would O
not O
sense O
the O
atrial O
contraction O
and O
the O
fire O
and O
this O
occasionally O
led O
to O
competition O
of O
firing O
. O

This O
was O
intermittent O
. O

The O
P O
wave O
amplitude O
was O
.6 O
and O
this O
could O
not O
be O
totally O
sensed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
management O
of O
her O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
and O
evaluation O
of O
her O
pacemaker O
. O

It O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
became O
very O
symptomatic O
when O
she O
was O
not O
on O
a O
beta O
blocker O
but O
that O
on O
a O
beta O
blocker O
she O
had O
significant O
pacemaker O
failure O
. O

Her O
pacemaker O
was O
set O
to O
a O
VVI O
mode O
which O
sensed O
appropriately O
. O

She O
was O
in O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

When O
her O
pacemaker O
was O
in O
a O
sinus O
rhythm O
without O
a O
beta O
blocker O
, O
she O
had O
significant O
angina O
. O

Carotid O
non-invasive O
testing O
was O
unremarkable O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
Niste B-DOCTOR
Graft I-DOCTOR
. O

He O
felt O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
a O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
graft O
candidate O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
conduit O
and O
because O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
large O
anterior O
myocardial O
infarction O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
maximize O
her O

was O
felt O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
a O
subclavian O

The O
patient O
underwent O
MRI O

suggested O
that O
the O

were O
not O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Ms. O
Shuffa B-PATIENT
underwent O
an O
EGD O
and O
flexible O
bronchoscopy O
on O
9/16 B-DATE
00 O
shortly O
after O
she O
arrived O
. O

This O
showed O
tracheal O
compressions O
but O
no O
other O
lesions O
that O
were O
obvious O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She O
was O
hemodynamically O
stable O
and O
remained O
on O
the O
ventilator O
. O

The O
differential O
diagnoses O
at O
this O
point O
consisted O
of O
hematoma O
vs. O
neoplasm O
vs. O
an O
abscess O
vs. O
a O
thyroid O
tumor O
. O

On O
9/22 B-DATE
00 O
, O
she O
underwent O
a O
cervical O
mediastinoscopy O
. O

A O
biopsy O
of O
this O
mass O
was O
consistent O
with O
hematoma O
. O

The O
operative O
report O
shows O
that O
there O
was O
an O
abnormal O
area O
below O
the O
trachea O
to O
the O
left O
which O
represented O
a O
cavity O
between O
the O
esophagus O
, O
trachea O
, O
aorta O
, O
and O
spine O
that O
was O
full O
of O
clot O

There O
was O
no O
active O

at O
the O

Over O
the O

several O
days O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
on O
the O

. O

She O
had O
an O
elevated O
calcium O
level O
that O
raised O
the O
suspicion O
that O
this O
mass O
could O
be O
a O
hematoma O
coming O
from O
a O
ruptured O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
. O

The O
ionized O
calcium O
was O
elevated O
as O
was O
the O
parathormone O
level O
. O

Given O
these O
findings O
, O
she O
underwent O
a O
Sestamibi O
scan O
. O

The O
Sestamibi O
scan O
showed O
findings O
that O
were O
consistent O
with O
a O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
in O
the O
right O
lobe O
of O
the O
thyroid O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
it O
was O
believed O
that O
her O
clot O
was O
due O
to O
a O
rupture O
of O
this O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
. O

Dr. O
Ear B-DOCTOR
brought O
the O
patient O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
10/5 B-DATE
00 O
. O

She O
underwent O
a O
parathyroid O
exploration O
with O
resection O
of O
a O
ruptured O
ectopic O
right O
upper O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
, O
a O
biopsy O
of O
a O
normal O
left O
and O
right O
lower O
parathyroids O
, O
resection O
of O
a O
left O
upper O
parathyroid O
, O
and O
tracheostomy O
. O

She O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well O
and O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
with O
her O
new O
tracheostomy O
working O
well O
. O

Her O
postoperative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
serosanguineous O
pleural O
effusion O
on O
the O
left O
. O

This O
required O
a O
chest O
tube O
. O

Her O
hematocrit O
continued O
to O
drop O
over O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
days O
despite O
normal O
platelet O
count O
, O
normal O
coags O
, O
and O
no O
obvious O
source O
of O
bleeding O
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
she O
was O
continuing O
to O
bleed O
in O
her O
chest O
. O

However O
, O
we O
are O
not O
quite O
sure O
why O
this O
was O
occurring O
. O

She O
underwent O
an O
extensive O
workup O
by O
Hematology O
that O
revealed O
a O
bleeding O
diatheses O
of O
unknown O
etiology O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
several O
people O
in O
her O
family O
have O
a O
similar O
bleeding O
diathesis O
of O
unknown O
etiology O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
by O
systems O
: O

1. O
Neuro O
. O

The O
patient O
became O
intermittently O
agitated O
. O

We O
have O
been O
giving O
her O
Haldol O
at O
bedtime O
as O
well O
as O
Ativan O
p.r.n. O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O

She O
responds O
well O
to O
this O
. O

She O
speaks O
some O
English O
and O
seems O
to O
understand O
more O
than O
she O
speaks O
. O

She O
has O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
present O
for O
approximately O
12 O
hours O
each O
day O
. O

She O
has O
been O
very O
helpful O
in O
translating O
and O
seems O
to O
say O
that O
Ms. O
Shuffa B-PATIENT
is O
in O
good O
spirits O
. O

2. O
Cardiac O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
blood O
pressure O
has O
been O
ranging O
from O
approximately O
140 O
to O
160 O
systolic O
. O

This O
is O
on O
a O
current O
regimen O
of O
Lopressor O
25 O
mg O

t.i.d. O
as O
well O
as O
Diltiazem O
60 O
mg O
per O
NG O
tube O
t.i.d. O
, O
and O
lisinopril O
10 O
mg O
per O
NG O
tube O
q.d. O
She O
occasionally O
gets O
hypertensive O
when O
she O
is O
agitated O
. O

For O
this O
, O
we O
have O
given O
her O
10 O
mg O
of O
hydralazine O
. O

Her O
blood O
pressure O
responds O
well O
to O
this O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
she O
is O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
has O
been O
hemodynamically O
stable O
throughout O
her O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
a O
left O
femoral O
artery O
pseudoaneurysm O
after O
placement O
of O
a O
Greenfield O
filter O
. O

This O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
the O
Vascular O
Surgery O
Service O
here O
at O
the O
Ingree B-HOSPITAL
and I-HOSPITAL
Ot I-HOSPITAL
of I-HOSPITAL
Weamanshy I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

Dr. O
Lenni B-DOCTOR
Lung I-DOCTOR
has O
been O
consulted O
. O

The O
aneurysm O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
is O
approximately O
2.5 O
cm O
. O

They O
elected O
not O
to O
inject O
it O
with O
thrombin O
. O

They O
asked O
that O
the O
patient O
follow-up O
with O
Dr. O
Ear B-DOCTOR
in O
approximately O
three O
to O
four O
weeks O
so O
that O
this O
aneurysm O
can O
be O
assessed O
. O

They O
have O
opted O
for O
conservative O
management O
given O
the O
size O
. O

3. O
Respiratory O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
on O
CPAP O
with O
a O
PEEP O
of O
7.5 O
and O
a O
pressure O
support O
of O
9 O
. O

She O
seems O
to O
be O
tolerating O
this O
well O
as O
she O
has O
an O
O2 O
sat O
of O
100% O
on O
40% O
FIO2 O
. O

Her O
chest O
x-ray O
shows O
a O
left O
lower O
lobe O
hematoma O
that O
had O
greatly O
improved O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

Her O
right O
lung O
field O
is O
clear O
. O

Her O
tracheostomy O
is O
functioning O
well O
, O
and O
we O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

She O
will O
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
weaned O
as O
tolerated O
. O

We O
had O
her O
down O
to O
a O
low O
pressure O
support O
of O
7 O
in O
the O
last O
week O
. O

With O
the O
pressure O
support O
at O
7 O
, O
she O
became O
tachypneic O
and O
had O
to O
be O
brought O
back O
up O
to O
10 O
. O

Her O
oxygen O
saturation O
has O
always O
been O
good O
. O

4. O
GI O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
getting O
tube O
feeds O
via O
her O
NG O
tube O
of O
full O
strength O
Jevity O
of O
75 O
cc O
per O
hour O
. O

This O
is O
her O
goal O
. O

She O
tolerates O
them O
very O
well O
and O
has O
approximately O
200 O
cc O
to O
300 O
cc O
of O
stool O
per O
day O
. O

Last O
week O
, O
she O
had O
copious O
amounts O
of O
stool O
in O
the O
range O
of O
500 O
cc O
to O
1000 O
cc O
of O
liquid O
stool O
per O
day O
. O

Stool O
cultures O
have O
been O
sent O
numerous O
times O
as O
well O
as O
analysis O
for O
C. O
difficile O
toxin O
. O

These O
have O
all O
been O
negative O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
this O
was O
an O
osmotic O
diarrhea O
. O

Since O
her O
tube O
feeds O
have O
been O
changed O
from O
full O
strength O
Nephro O
to O
Jevity O
, O
her O
diarrhea O
has O
resolved O
. O

She O
has O
been O
taking O
Zantac O
, O
and O
the O
pH O
of O
her O
NG O
tube O
residuals O
have O
been O
in O
the O
5 O
to O
8 O
range O
. O

5. O
GU O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
hypernatremia O
. O

She O
is O
approximately O
10 O
kg O
up O
her O
overall O
body O
weight O
. O

We O
believe O
her O
to O
still O
be O
total O
body O
overloaded O
. O

Over O
the O
last O
several O
days O
, O
we O
have O
been O
giving O
her O
approximately O
500 O
cc O
to O
1000 O
cc O
of O
free O
water O
through O
her O
NG O
tube O
. O

We O
also O
have O
been O
diuresing O
her O
with O
Bumex O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
trend O
her O
sodium O
down O
. O

This O
will O
need O
to O
be O
monitored O
closely O
. O

Her O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
have O
been O
normal O
, O
and O
she O
has O
always O
made O
good O
urine O
. O

6. O
Heme O
. O

As O
stated O
before O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
ooze O
into O
her O
pleural O
space O
well O
after O
her O
definitive O
operation O
. O

She O
had O
an O
extensive O
workup O
by O
Hematology O
which O
revealed O
a O
bleeding O
diathesis O
of O
unknown O
origin O
. O

Before O
we O
removed O
her O
chest O
tube O
, O
we O
had O
to O
give O
her O
platelets O
. O

She O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
this O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
her O
hematocrit O
is O
stable O
in O
the O
28 O
to O
33 O
range O
. O

I O
stress O
that O
she O
cannot O
be O
anticoagulated O
. O

We O
have O
given O
her O
Lovenox O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
she O
continues O
to O
bleed O
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
is O
on O
no O
DVT O
prophylaxis O
. O

She O
does O
have O
a O
left O
iliac O
deep O
vein O
thrombosis O
. O

She O
has O
a O
Greenfield O
filter O
in O
place O
, O
and O
this O
is O
her O
only O
DVT O
prophylaxis O
. O

7. O
ID O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
a O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
. O

She O
is O
growing O
Enterobacter O
cloacae O
that O
is O
sensitive O
only O
to O
Macrodantin O
from O
her O
urine O
cultures O
. O

Interestingly O
enough O
, O
she O
also O
has O
Enterobacter O
cloacae O
growing O
out O
of O
her O
sputum O
. O

This O
is O
also O
sensitive O
only O
to O
Macrodantin O
. O

We O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
she O
has O
any O
respiratory O
process O
going O
on O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She O
is O
just O
begun O
on O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

Ms. O
A B-PATIENT
is O
a O
48-year-old O
woman O
, O
who O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
breast O
cancer O
in O
May B-DATE
of O
1998 O
. O

She O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
May B-DATE
of O
1997 O
, O
when O
her O
right O
breast O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
abnormal O
on O
mammography O
. O

Biopsy O
of O
this O
specific O
area O
was O
negative O
. O

Subsequent O
mammography O
was O
, O
reportedly O
, O
benign O
and O
without O
significant O
interval O
change O
. O

However O
, O
by O
May B-DATE
1998 O
, O
she O
had O
appreciated O
a O
fullness O
in O
the O
right O
breast O
, O
and O
noted O
the O
emergence O
of O
a O
mass O
, O
which O
increased O
in O
size O
over O
time O
. O

Mammography O
was O
repeated O
, O
which O
was O
highly O
suspicious O
for O
malignancy O
. O

An O
ultrasound O
of O
the O
lesion O
was O
similarly O
suspicious O
for O
neoplasm O
. O

The O
patient O
, O
therefore O
, O
went O
to O
incisional O
biopsy O
, O
which O
confirmed O
invasive O
ductal O
carcinoma O
. O

She O
, O
subsequently O
, O
underwent O
mastectomy O
with O
axillary O
lymph O
node O
dissection O
( O
November B-DATE
1998 O
) O
. O

The O
final O
results O
from O
pathology O
revealed O
a O
very O
large O
tumor O
measuring O
14 O
centimeters O
in O
size O
permeating O
the O
whole O
breast O
with O
a O
positive O
deep O
margin O
. O

The O
tumor O
was O
described O
as O
histologically O
nuclear O
grade O
III O
with O
extensive O
lymphatic O
vascular O
invasion O
. O

ER O
and O
PR O
were O
strongly O
positive O
, O
although O
, O
a O
K-617 O
index O
was O
unfavorable O
at O
30 O
percent O
with O
a O
high O
esterase O
. O

DNA O
content O
was O
deployed O
. O

On O
examination O
of O
the O
lymph O
nodes O
, O
22 O
of O
24 O
lymph O
nodes O
sampled O
were O
involved O
with O
carcinoma O
. O

Subsequent O
to O
surgery O
, O
she O
had O
an O
uncomplicated O
recovery O
. O

She O
then O
went O
on O
to O
dose-intensive O
Adriamycin O
and O
tolerated O
this O
procedure O
remarkably O
well O
. O

Restaging O
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O
interval O
progression O
and O
the O
patient O
, O
therefore O
, O
went O
on O
to O
high-dose O
cyclophosphamide O
for O
stem O
cell O
mobilization O
. O

Leukophoresis O
went O
well O
and O
stem O
cell O
yields O
were O
excellent O
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
is O
being O
admitted O
for O
intensification O
with O
high-dose O
cyclophosphamide O
, O
thiotepa O
, O
and O
carboplatin O
followed O
by O
stem O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1998 O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
retroperitoneal O
mass O
which O
ultimately O
revealed O
angiosarcoma O
of O
presumed O
germ-cell O
transformation O
. O

In O
early O
1999 O
he O
underwent O
resection O
of O
this O
mass O
however O
in O
February B-DATE
of O
1999 O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
new O
right O
pleural O
mass O
and O
subsequently O
underwent O
pleurodesis O
and O
chemotherapy O
with O
ifosfamide O
and O
Adriamycin O
for O
six O
cycles O
. O

In O
05 B-DATE
99 O
he O
had O
increasing O
abdominal O
pain O
and O
evaluation O
revealed O
extensive O
progressive O
retroperitoneal O
disease O
as O
well O
as O
left O
hydronephrosis O
. O

In O
early O
2000 O
he O
was O
started O
on O

with O
Taxol O
per O
Dr. O
Azel B-DOCTOR
Hibbskays I-DOCTOR
and O

at O
that O
time O
was O
negative O
for O
disease O
. O

In O
April B-DATE
of O
this O
year O
, O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
acute O
renal O
failure O
with O
left O
hydronephrosis O
and O
this O
was O
treated O
with O
percutaneous O
nephrostomy O
tube O
on O
that O
side O
. O

Thereafter O
he O
began O
chemotherapy O
with O
Taxotere O
in O
05/13 B-DATE
and O
his O
nephrostomy O
tube O
was O
removed O
after O
being O
displaced O
on O
06/14 B-DATE
00 O
. O

Most O
recently O
he O
has O
had O
problems O
with O
nausea O
, O
vomiting O
, O
fever O
and O
left O
sided O
abdominal O
pain O
and O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Pointexasp B-HOSPITAL
Region I-HOSPITAL
General I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
on O
06/16 B-DATE
00 O
. O

That O
hospital O
course O
was O
sign O
for O
hydration O
, O
antibiotics O
for O
questionable O
pneumonia O
and O
more O
importantly O
, O
tachycardia O
and O
respiratory O
distress O
ultimately O
secondary O
to O
a O
large O
left O
pulmonary O
arterial O
mass O
that O
was O
likely O
a O
thrombus O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
intra-arterial O
thrombolysis O
( O
TPA O
) O
and O
was O
discharged O
on O
06/28 B-DATE
00 O
on O
high O
dose O
, O
low O
molecular O
weight O
Heparin O
. O

It O
was O
entirely O
clear O
that O
this O
mass O
represents O
a O
clot O
, O
certainly O
this O
could O
have O
been O
tumor O
embolization O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
hyponatremia O
with O
a O
sodium O
down O
to O
130 O

HISTORY O
AND O
REASON O
FOR O
HOSPITALIZATION O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
79 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
an O
ascending O
aortic O
graft O
replacement O
in O
1991 O
for O
aortic O
dissection O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hospital O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
a O
sternal O
wound O
infection O
requiring O
a O
sternal O
debridement O
and O
subsequent O
abdominal O
flap O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
continued O
by O
report O
on O
Dicloxacillin O
for O
approximately O
one O
year O
following O
that O
reconstructive O
operation O
. O

The O
patient O
apparently O
did O
well O
until O
June B-DATE
1998 O
when O
he O
noted O
a O
bulge O
in O
his O
sternal O
area O
. O

A O
ruptured O
aneurysm O
or O
pseudoaneurysm O
at O
the O
junction O
of O
the O
graft O
and O
arch O
was O
diagnosed O
and O
this O
was O
subsequently O
repaired O
. O

The O
patient O
then O
had O
recurrent O
bleeding O
two O
weeks O
later O
which O
was O
once O
again O
repaired O
. O

However O
the O
same O
problem O
recurred O
for O
a O
third O
time O
and O
a O
computer O
tomogram O
scan O
at O
an O
outside O
hospital O
showed O
an O
anterior O
hematoma O
. O

By O
report O
the O
patient O
was O
at O
that O
time O
told O
that O
there O
was O
no O
more O
that O
could O
be O
done O
for O
him O
and O
was O
then O
apparently O
placed O
on O
comfort O
measures O
and O
pain O
control O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
. O

However O
the O
patient O
was O
then O
subsequently O
transferred O
to O
Fairm B-HOSPITAL
of I-HOSPITAL
Ijordcompmac I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
upon O
request O
of O
the O
family O
on O
8/24 B-DATE
98 O
for O
further O
evaluation O
and O
possible O
intervention O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Rhalt B-DOCTOR
of O
Dentvailr. B-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
. O

As O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
early O
evaluation O
the O
patient O
underwent O
an O
aortogram O
which O
showed O
an O
ascending O
aortic O
graft O
with O
bulging O
flaps O
and O
a O
pseudoaneurysm O
at O
the O
anastomosis O
of O
the O
graft O
and O
arch O
just O
below O
the O
great O
vessels O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
for O
a O
definite O
leak O
but O
there O
was O
evidence O
for O
gas O
bubbles O
in O
the O
anterior O
posterior O
distal O
ends O
of O
the O
grafts O
consistent O
with O
an O
infectious O
process O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
who O
upon O
culturing O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
sternal O
drainage O
switched O
the O
patient O
from O
intravenous O
Unasyn O
to O
Levofloxacin O
for O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
Citrobacter O
and O
Diphtheroids O
in O
the O
wound O
cultures O
. O

Subsequent O
to O
starting O
this O
antibiotic O
regimen O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
wound O
drainage O
appeared O
to O
subside O
. O

Given O
all O
the O
findings O
on O
the O
aortogram O
and O
the O
subsequent O
chest O
computer O
tomogram O
scan O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
only O
real O
surgical O
option O
for O
cure O
was O
a O
risky O
operation O
that O
involved O
removal O
and O
replacement O
of O
the O
aortic O
graft O
probably O
with O
homograft O
and O
long O
term O
antibiotic O
coverage O
as O
well O
as O
a O
plastic O
surgical O
reconstructive O
procedure O
. O

The O
patient O
understood O
the O
risks O
and O
potential O
benefits O
of O
the O
procedure O
and O
was O
willing O
to O
proceed O
. O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
complained O
of O
no O
angina O
, O
no O
shortness O
of O

, O
no O

intraoperative O
cultures O
had O
also O
grown O
out O
Mycoplasma O
humilius O
. O

Given O
this O
finding O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
certainly O
need O
long O
term O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
to O
include O
at O
least O
six O
weeks O
of O
Vancomycin O
and O
then O
subsequent O
Levofloxacin O
for O
the O
Citrobacter O
and O
Mycoplasma O
as O
well O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
scheduled O
for O
peripherally O
inserted O
central O
catheter O
line O
placement O
knowing O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
need O
long O
term O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
. O

This O
was O
placed O
on O
postoperative O
day O
no. O
9 O
without O
any O
difficulty O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
stable O
on O
his O
antihypertensive O
regimen O
. O

He O
was O
becoming O
more O
mobile O
and O
was O
taking O
a O
high O
protein O
high O
calories O
diet O
which O
he O
tolerated O
well O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
be O
afebrile O
and O
otherwise O
very O
stable O
. O

On O
postoperative O
day O
no. O
12 O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
fallen O
and O
subsequently O
dislocating O
the O
PIP O
joint O
of O
his O
left O
middle O
finger O
. O

Subsequent O
hand O
x-rays O
obtained O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
fracture O
but O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Plastic O
Surgery O
Hand O
Service O
. O

The O
patient O
will O
benefit O
from O
splinting O
of O
his O
finger O
while O
the O
swelling O
subsided O
and O
subsequent O
early O
mobilization O
to O
prevent O
any O
rigidity O
in O
that O
joint O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
seen O
subsequently O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Plastic O
Surgical O
Service O
who O
discontinued O
a O
number O
of O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
indwelling O
drains O
but O
they O
felt O
that O
others O
needed O
to O
stay O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
sent O
to O
rehabilitation O
. O

These O
drains O
will O
then O
be O
subsequently O
taken O
out O
by O
Dr. O
General B-DOCTOR
upon O
his O
followup O
with O
the O
patient O
. O

Prior O
to O
discharge O
the O
patient O
also O
underwent O
an O
audiogram O
as O
a O
baseline O
hearing O
test O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
to O
stay O
on O
long O
term O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
. O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
continued O
to O
be O
hemodynamically O
stable O
making O
good O
progress O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
the O
patient O
made O
remarkable O
progress O
given O
the O
severity O
of O
his O
disease O
condition O
prior O
to O
the O
operation O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O

continued O

Review O
of O
the O
electrocardiograms O
from O
Haold B-HOSPITAL
Memorial I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
demonstrated O
atrial O
flutter O
with O
variable O
conduction O
. O

She O
was O
in O
sinus O
tachycardia O
here O
with O
right O
bundle O
branch O
block O
and O
continued O
ST O
segment O
elevation O
with O
Qs O
in O
3 O
and O
AVF O
. O

She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Coronary O
Care O
Unit O
where O
she O
continued O
to O
have O
intermittent O
marked O
bradycardia O
with O
junctional O
rhythm O
and O
relatively O
low O
blood O
pressures O
and O
runs O
of O
flow O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
. O

She O
became O
increasingly O
disoriented O
. O

She O
developed O
first O
degree O
AV O
block O
and O
then O
Wenckebach O
block O
. O

The O
chest O
films O
showed O
mild O
cephalization O
. O

She O
became O
very O
drowsy O
with O
sedation O
when O
she O
developed O
some O
agitation O
and O
required O
intubation O
. O

She O
went O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
because O
of O
low O
cardiac O
output O
and O
shock O
. O

She O
had O
ventricular O
pacing O
and O
the O
cardiac O
output O
came O
up O
to O
2.3 O
. O

Catheter O
study O
then O
revealed O
right O
coronary O
occlusion O
with O
no O
significant O
left O
sided O
disease O
. O

The O
right O
coronary O
artery O
had O
a O
large O
burden O
of O
intravascular O
thrombus O
and O
she O
was O
eventually O
able O
to O
have O
the O
clot O
cleared O
and O
a O
near O
2.5 O
stent O
was O
placed O
with O
good O
result O
. O

She O
had O
TIMI O
2 O
to O
3 O
flow O
in O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
after O
stenting O
and O
removal O
of O
clot O
from O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
intermittent O
runs O
of O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
. O

She O
remained O
intubated O
but O
her O
hemodynamics O
improved O
somewhat O
. O

Dobutamine O
was O
diminished O
because O
of O
the O
wide O
complex O
tachycardia O
and O
she O
developed O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

She O
was O
initially O
tried O
on O
intravenous O
Pronestyl O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
restore O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

She O
was O
later O
switched O
to O
Amiodarone O
but O
there O
continued O
to O
be O
no O
effect O
on O
her O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

Eventually O
her O
lines O
were O
able O
to O
be O
withdrawn O
and O
she O
was O
moved O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

She O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
wheezing O
and O
in O
late O
January B-DATE
she O
had O
continued O
elevated O
wedge O
pressure O
and O
her O
creatinine O
started O
to O
rise O
to O
3.2 O
and O
then O
4 O
with O
nonoliguric O
renal O
failure O
. O

She O
was O
then O
returned O
to O
the O
Unit O
where O
she O
underwent O
further O
monitoring O
. O

The O
BUN O
rose O
to O
91 O
. O

Her O
Digoxin O
level O
was O
1.9 O
on O
February B-DATE
6 I-DATE
. O

She O
was O
able O
eventually O
to O
be O
extubated O
and O
moved O
back O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

Efforts O
to O
mobilize O
her O
began O
in O
early O
January B-DATE
and O
an O
echocardiogram O
demonstrated O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
49% O
. O

The O
right O
ventricular O
function O
was O
normal O
. O

After O
extubation O
she O
developed O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
upper O
respiratory O
stridor O
which O
was O
treated O
initially O
with O
Decadron O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
ENT O
consultants O
who O
found O
that O
she O
had O
some O
hardened O
inspissated O
secretions O
in O
the O
region O
of O
the O
vocal O
cords O
, O
glottic O
inlet O
and O
subglottis O
. O

There O
was O
no O
structural O
abnormality O
. O

Moistened O
oxygen O
and O
Mucomyst O
was O
given O
with O
eventual O
restoration O
of O
her O
voice O
and O
diminution O
in O
her O
stridor O
. O

She O
continued O
a O
rather O
slow O
improvement O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Drs. O
Morning B-DOCTOR
and O
Morning B-DOCTOR
because O
of O
the O
abnormalities O
of O
renal O
function O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
was O
raised O
and O
she O
eventually O
was O
able O
to O
have O
a O
MRI O
. O

She O
had O
some O
hematuria O
and O
was O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Ryna B-DOCTOR
Jescdrig I-DOCTOR
. O

Renal O
and O
bladder O
ultrasounds O
were O
normal O
. O

She O
had O
abnormal O
urinary O
cytology O
however O
and O
Dr. O
Jescdrig B-DOCTOR
strongly O
recommended O
that O
this O
be O
followed O
up O
by O
cystoscopy O
when O
she O
is O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

That O
can O
take O
place O
either O
here O
at O
his O
office O
or O
in O
Aersing B-LOCATION
Rocuch I-LOCATION
Sun I-LOCATION
or O
when O
she O
returns O
to O
Carfachemoses B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
. O

Because O
of O
alternating O
and O
fluctuating O
mental O
status O
, O
she O
had O
a O
head O
CT O
scan O
which O
showed O
small O
area O
of O
intracranial O
bleeding O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
up O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
resolve O
. O

MR O
angiogram O
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
. O

A O
MRI O
of O
the O
head O
because O
of O
the O
small O
area O
of O
bleeding O
was O
done O
to O
look O
for O
amyloid O
angiopathy O
which O
would O
have O
made O
anticoagulation O
dangerous O
. O

She O
was O
then O
begun O
on O
Coumadin O
when O
none O
was O
found O
and O
is O
now O
being O
transferred O
to O
rehabilitation O

. O

Subsequently O
in O
10 B-DATE
92 O
he O
underwent O
a O
wide O
excision O
with O
axillary O
dissection O
which O
showed O
residual O
malignant O
melanoma O
with O
nine O
negative O
lymph O
nodes O
. O

He O
had O
a O
recurrence O
in O
05 B-DATE
99 O
in O
a O
similar O
area O
which O
was O
2.1 O
mm O
in O
thickness O
. O

He O
had O
this O
resected O
between O
8/4 B-DATE
and O
9/5 B-DATE
97 O
and O
was O
treated O
with O
6000 O
C O
of O
radiation O
therapy O
over O
the O
right O
upper O
extremity O
. O

He O
has O
done O
well O
since O
that O
time O
and O
subsequently O
in O
05 B-DATE
98 O
had O
pulmonary O
nodules O
which O
were O
noted O
and O
a O
computer O
tomogram O
scan O
in O
08 B-DATE
98 O
demonstrated O
a O
4.2 O
cm O
splenic O
lesion O
. O

He O
underwent O
an O
open O
splenectomy O
in O
the O
Fall O
1998 O
which O
demonstrated O
metastatic O
melanoma O
only O
to O
the O
spleen O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
he O
has O
been O
treated O
with O
_______ O
cells O
in O
1999 O
and O
also O
with O
Allovecting O
injection O
to O
the O
right O
anterior O
axillary O
nodule O
. O

Most O
recently O
in O
he O
has O
this O
right O
anterior O
axillary O
metastatic O
melanoma O
resected O
at O
Brook B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
by O
Dr. O
Bainpruess B-DOCTOR
on O
with O
local O
triceps O
myocutaneous O
tissue O
transfer O
. O

Since O
April B-DATE
through O
July B-DATE
this O
area O
has O
increased O
in O
size O
where O
the O
triceps O
tissue O
transfer O
has O
been O
replaced O
with O
a O
bulky O
metastatic O
melanoma O
disease O
. O

Surgical O
consultation O
for O
resection O
of O
this O
for O
local O
___ O
control O
was O
requested O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
___ O
Dr. O
Peakekudz B-DOCTOR
and O
has O
known O
visceral O
metastases O
of O
the O
liver O
as O
well O
the O
lung O
with O
mediastinal O
adenopathy O
which O
has O
been O
stable O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

The O
other O
complicating O
factor O
in O
his O
care O
was O
that O
he O
was O
wheelchair O
bound O
from O
a O
viral O
meningeal O
encephalomyelitis O
in O
1966 O
and O
has O
relied O
heavily O
on O
his O
upper O
extremity O
for O
wheelchair O
transfer O
and O
access O
and O
transportation O
. O

In O
order O
to O
workup O
up O
this O
metastatic O
melanoma O
recurrent O
after O
local O
excision O
only O
two O
months O
previously O
it O
was O
elected O
to O
get O
an O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scan O
of O
the O
shoulder O
. O

This O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scan O
confirmed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
large O
mass O
which O
measured O
approximately O
4-6cm O
anterior O
to O
the O
deltopectoral O
groove O
and O
unfortunately O
a O
smaller O
lesion O
1cm O
was O
seen O
separately O
adjacent O
and O
medial O
to O
the O
biceps O
tendon O
near O
the O
brachial O
neurovascular O
bundle O
. O

An O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scan O
which O
was O
performed O
three O
months O
prior O
to O
admission O
to O
Brook B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
for O
resection O
demonstrated O
that O
this O
more O
medial O
lesion O
was O
not O
present O
at O
that O
time O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
suspicious O
for O
metastatic O
melanoma O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
fine O
needle O
aspiration O
of O
this O
bulky O
tumor O
mass O
which O
demonstrated O
malignant O
melanoma O
and O
subsequently O
he O
was O
sent O
for O
a O
positron O
emission O

scan O
which O
was O
performed O
at O
S B-HOSPITAL
Nakantlakeing I-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL

Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
on O
8/24 B-DATE

. O

The O
positron O
emission O

scan O
demonstrated O
a O
known O
larger O
anterior O
metastatic O
melanoma O
and O
more O
medially O
two O
approximately O
1cm O
lesions O
that O
also O
enhanced O
. O

These O
were O
consistent O
with O
metastatic O
melanoma O
near O
the O
brachial O
plexus O
confirmed O
by O
the O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scan O
. O

The O

again O
lost O
his O

with O
a O
few O
schistocytes O
. O

The O
platelet O

, O
hematocrit O
was O
26.5 O
, O
with O
an O
mean O
corpuscular O
volume O
of O
about O
73 O
. O

His O
prothrombin O
time O
and O
partial O
thromboplastin O
time O
were O
normal O
. O

His O
uric O

, O
his O
total O
bilirubin O
was O
up O
at O
1.8 O
, O
his O

, O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
13/1.6 O
, O
and O
sugar O
of O
267 O
. O

A O
computerized O

scan O
of O
his O
head O
showed O
no O
signs O
of O
an O
acute O
bleed O
, O
a O
chest O
X-ray O
showed O
no O
new O
infiltrates O
or O

. O

There O
was O
cardiomegaly O
with O
prominent O
vascularity O
, O
but O
no O
effusions O
. O

An O
electrocardiogram O
was O
consistent O
with O
atrial O
fibrillation O
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
begun O
on O
high O
dose O
Hydroxyurea O
, O
with O
a O
gradual O
improvement O
in O
his O
white O
blood O
count O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

He O
did O
spike O
a O
fever O
and O
began O
Ancef O
and O
Gentamicin O
, O
although O
cultures O
never O
revealed O
a O
source O
for O
this O
. O

He O
also O
tried O
Amicar O
and O
continued O
on O
low O
dose O
Prednisone O
. O

His O
headache O
improved O
, O
but O
her O
remained O
profoundly O
weak O
and O
intermittently O
febrile O
with O
dyspnea O
. O

There O
was O
hemoptysis O
and O
intermittent O
gastrointestinal O
bleeding O
, O
while O
he O
remained O
profoundly O
thrombocytopenia O
. O

Transfusions O
of O
platelets O
did O
not O
change O
his O
platelet O
count O
, O
presumably O
because O
of O
sequestration O
and O
a O
massive O
spleen O
. O

Amicar O
was O
of O
uncertain O
value O
, O
but O
used O
intermittently O
. O

A O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
revealed O
the O
transformation O
of O
his O
CMML O
to O
acute O
myelogenous O
leukemia O
, O
and O
given O
his O
other O
underlying O
medical O
problems O
, O
we O
chose O
chemotherapy O
with O
subcutaneous O
Cystosine O
Arabinoside O
and O
6-Thioguanine O
, O
which O
he O
tolerated O
without O
incident O
and O
this O
brought O
his O
white O
blood O
count O
down O
to O
below O
1,000 O
, O
and O
his O
spleen O
shrank O
noticeably O
, O
but O
he O
still O
could O
not O
maintain O
a O
bump O
in O
platelet O
count O
with O
platelet O
transfusions O
. O

He O
was O
intermittently O
congested O
limiting O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
intravenous O
fluid O
, O
for O
his O
hydrea O
, O
although O
we O
kept O
him O
on O
Allopurinol O
. O

The O
renal O
function O
deteriorated O
somewhat O
, O
hampering O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
him O
his O
Gentamicin O
. O

The O
family O
maintained O
an O
extraordinary O
vigil O
over O
the O
days O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
providing O
him O
with O
some O
food O
and O
constant O
attention O
, O
while O
we O
awaited O
the O
results O
of O
his O
chemotherapy O
and O
treatment O
of O
his O
infection O
. O

He O
was O
intermittently O
restless O
and O
somewhat O
confused O
, O
and O
as O
his O
respiratory O
status O
deteriorated O
, O
the O
family O
agreed O
to O
a O
low O
dose O
Morphine O
drip O
which O
made O
him O
much O
more O
comfortable O
. O

They O
agreed O
with O
a O

. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
further O
evaluation O
and O
work O
up O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Intermediate O
Care O
Unit O
in O
the O
Neurology O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

However O
, O
she O
was O
soon O
moved O
out O
of O
there O
as O
her O
examination O
appeared O
to O
be O
stable O
. O

A O
Neurosurgery O
Service O
consultation O
was O
obtained O
and O
they O
felt O
that O
no O
surgical O
intervention O
was O
required O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
a O
number O
of O
tests O
. O

She O
had O
a O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
study O
and O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
angiogram O
performed O
which O
showed O
a O
large O
hemorrhagic O
lesion O
on O
the O
occipital O
lobe O
. O

There O
was O
no O
clear O
enhancing O
mass O
, O
but O
follow O
up O
was O
suggested O
. O

So O
an O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
angiogram O
was O
obtained O
and O
showed O
the O
right O
parietal O
occipital O
hemorrhage O
. O

The O
MRA O
showed O
mild O
narrowing O
of O
the O
left O
ICA O
just O
distal O
to O
the O
bifurcation O
. O

There O
was O
also O
scattered O
T2 O
hyperintense O
foci O
within O
the O
periventricular O
and O
left O
frontal O
white O

consistent O
with O
small O

disease O
, O
gliosis O
or O
demyelination O
. O

A O
Holter O
monitor O
was O
obtained O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

The O
heart O
rate O
was O
53 O
to O
106 O
. O

There O
were O
some O
very O
rare O
atrial O
premature O
contractions O
. O

There O
were O
no O
ventricular O
premature O
contractions O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
was O
obtained O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
60% O
and O
there O
was O
no O
thrombus O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

Over O
the O
ensuing O
days O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
several O
episodes O
of O
confusion O
at O
night O
. O

However O
, O
these O
gradually O
resolved O
. O

She O
also O
developed O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
and O
was O
placed O
on O
PO O
Bactrim O
. O

By O
6-26 B-DATE
94 O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
discharge O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
she O
was O
afebrile O
and O
her O
vital O
signs O
were O
stable O
. O

She O
was O
tolerating O
a O
regular O

. O

She O
was O
awake O
, O

, O
and O
time O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
a O
dense O

, O
but O
otherwise O
was O

continued O

remained O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Ponta,itri- B-HOSPITAL
University I-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
as O
a O
front O
door O
admission O
and O
although O
her O
electrocardiogram O
is O
equivocal O
, O
a O
second O
potassium O
also O
came O
back O
elevated O
so O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
two O
doses O
of O
sodium O
K-exulate O
with O
improvement O
of O
her O
potassium O
to O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

Over O
the O
following O
days O
, O
she O
was O
gently O
hydrated O
. O

Her O
urine O
was O
alkalinized O
using O
intravenous O
and O
later O
oral O
sodium O
bicarbonate O
and O
her O
creatinine O
rose O
to O
a O
high O
of O
about O
5.8 O
. O

She O
was O
seen O
by O
the O
nephrology O
service O
and O
it O
was O
deemed O
quite O
likely O
that O
the O
acute O
and O
chronic O
renal O
insufficiency O
that O
had O
progressed O
causing O
this O
admission O
was O
related O
to O
her O
myeloma O
kidney O
. O

In O
the O
weeks O
prior O
to O
admission O
she O
had O
just O
begun O
thalidomide O
orally O
as O
a O
salvage O
treatment O
for O
her O
myeloma O
. O

She O
tolerated O
without O
sedation O
but O
probably O
was O
not O
at O
a O
therapeutic O
dose O
and O
it O
had O
had O
no O
impact O
by O
the O
time O
of O
her O
admission O
. O

The O
patient O
, O
her O
son O
Randdor B-PATIENT
So I-PATIENT
and O
I O
had O
several O
long O
conversations O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
further O
renal O
deterioration O
and O
need O
for O
hemodialysis O
. O

The O
family O
and O
the O
patient O
felt O
quite O
clearly O
that O
hemodialysis O
was O
not O
indicated O
if O
the O
underlying O
myeloma O
was O
not O
controllable O
. O

They O
did O
agree O
, O
however O
to O
one O
more O
attempt O
at O
pulse O
Decadron O
therapy O
with O
consists O
of O
oral O
Decadron O
forty O
mgs O
PO O
q.day O
( O
in O
divided O
doses O
) O
for O
four O
consecutive O
days O
followed O
by O
four O
days O
off O
, O
followed O
by O
four O
days O
on O
, O
etc. O
for O
a O
total O
of O
eight O
sessions O
of O
four O
days O
of O
Decadron O
on O
. O

By O
the O
time O
she O
had O
left O
she O
had O
completed O
only O
the O
first O
of O
the O
four O
consecutive O
days O
as O
expected O
her O
blood O
sugars O
went O
up O
into O
high O
300&apos;s O
or O
400s O
and O
she O
needed O
sliding O
scale O
regular O
insulin O
in O
addition O
to O
standing O
doses O
of O
NPH O
. O

On O
the O
days O
when O
she O
was O
not O
on O
Decadron O
the O
standing O
doses O
of O
NPH O
were O
sometimes O
suspended O
because O
her O
blood O
sugars O
would O
get O
to O
41 O
and O
she O
would O
have O
remarkably O
few O
symptoms O
in O
this O
setting O
, O
perhaps O
related O
to O
the O
low O
dose O
beta O
blockers O
that O
she O
also O
takes O
. O

There O
had O
been O
a O
slight O
down O
turn O
in O
her O
creatinine O
by O
discharge O
to O
4.7 O
but O
there O
was O
concern O
that O
she O
could O
not O
tolerate O
any O
greater O
hydration O
rates O
due O
to O
crackles O
in O
her O
bases O
although O
her O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
went O
about O
six O
and O
she O
was O
never O
symptomatic O
with O
fluid O
overload O
. O

Potassium O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
throughout O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
hospitalization O
. O

She O
was O
also O
seen O
by O
the O
pain O
service O
who O
was O
baffled O
by O
the O
cause O
for O
her O
lower O
extremity O
leg O
pain O
that O
has O
been O
present O
for O
several O
years O
, O
not O
progressive O
, O
minimally O
responsive O
to O
narcotics O
and O
currently O
on O
a O
second O
trial O
of O
Neurontin O
of O
dubious O
value O
and O
would O
probably O
by O
the O
first O
medicine O
that O
I O
discontinue O
if O
she O
was O
feeling O
too O
sleepy O
or O
weak O
. O

The O
problem O
may O
be O
a O
combination O
of O
degenerative O
joint O
disease O
with O
spinal O
stenosis O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
floor O
with O
variable O
changes O
in O
his O
EKG O
. O

He O
became O
pain O
free O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
and O
was O
initially O
admitted O
to O
Evinlandcalco B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
. O

However O
, O
he O
developed O
recurrent O
chest O
discomfort O
on O
the O
floor O
with O
worsening O
of O
his O
anterior O
ST O
segments O
with O
elevation O
, O
and O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
. O

In O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
, O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
showed O
RA O
7 O
, O
RV O
36/9 O
, O
wedge O
16 O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
Integrelin O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
intravenous O
heparin O
, O
aspirin O
, O
and O
nitrates O
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
have O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
occluded O
proximally O
with O
right O
to O
left O
collaterals O
. O

The O
circumflex O
was O
codominant O
with O
severe O
90% O
lesion O
proximally O
in O
the O
circumflex O
and O
50% O
lesion O
in O
a O
large O
OM O
. O

The O
right O
coronary O
artery O
was O
codominant O
and O
had O
an O
ostial O
stenosis O
in O
the O
70% O
range O
. O

Left O
ventriculography O
revealed O
an O
akinetic O
anterolateral O
wall O
. O

A O
balloon O
pump O
was O
placed O
and O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
was O
performed O
showing O
the O
above O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
worsening O
ST O
elevation O
on O
the O
monitor O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
open O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
. O

The O
procedure O
was O
reasonably O
complicated O
in O
that O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
had O
poor O
re-flow O
and O
two O
stents O
needed O
to O
be O
placed O
, O
as O
there O
was O
a O
second O
lesion O
in O
the O
mid O
left O
anterior O
descending O
. O

The O
distal O
vessel O
was O
quite O
diseased O
and O
poor O
with O
regard O
to O
vessel O
quality O
and O
caliber O
. O

A O
good O
result O
was O
obtained O
with O
a O
stent O
in O
the O
proximal O
left O
anterior O
descending O
and O
a O
stent O
in O
the O
mid O
left O
anterior O
descending O
and O
the O
patient O
went O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
on O
a O
balloon O
pump O
, O
intubated O
. O

His O
peak O
CPK O
was O
in O
the O
3000 O
range O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
hemoptysis O
while O
intubated O
and O
on O
Integrelin O
and O
heparin O
. O

He O
underwent O
bronchoscopy O
, O
which O
showed O
no O
specific O
lesion O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
chest O
CT O
showed O
no O
obvious O
reason O
for O
his O
hemoptysis O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
atelectasis O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
perhaps O
the O
patient O
had O
atelectasis O
and O
perhaps O
some O
aspiration O
, O
which O
predisposed O
him O
to O
hemoptysis O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
confusion O
and O
delirium O
. O

Head O
CT O
was O
without O
any O
obvious O
intracranial O
catastrophe O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Neurology O
and O
Psychiatry O
services O
and O
felt O
to O
have O
cognitive O
deficits O
and O
was O
ultimately O
controlled O
and O
managed O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
Seroquel O
and O
Haldol O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
sitter O
during O
parts O
of O
his O
hospital O
course O
to O
keep O
him O
oriented O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
return O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
lab O
on O
2/2 B-DATE
02 O
to O
receive O
a O
stent O
to O
the O
tight O
circumflex O
. O

This O
was O
uneventful O
, O
without O
the O
need O
for O
intubation O
, O
etc O
, O
and O
the O
procedure O
went O
smoothly O
. O

He O
tolerated O
it O
well O
. O

The O
ostial O
right O
coronary O
was O
a O
relatively O
small O
vessel O
for O
the O
patient O
and O
was O
not O
approached O
this O
admission O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Evinlandcalco B-HOSPITAL
Hospital I-HOSPITAL
. O

He O
had O
difficulties O
with O
urinary O
incontinence O
and O
required O
straight O
catheterization O
for O
post-void O
residuals O
up O
until O
the O
time O
of O
this O
dictation O
. O

He O
was O
still O
having O
300 O
cc O
or O
so O
post-void O
remaining O
in O
his O
bladder O
. O

He O
is O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Squithsherl B-DOCTOR
in O
this O
regard O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
dictation O
, O
the O
plan O
is O
for O
probable O
transfer O
to O
a O
rehabilitation O
facility O
for O
physical O
therapy O
. O

He O
has O
had O
no O
recurrent O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Please O
refer O
to O
the O
operative O
note O
by O
Dr. O
Etteme B-DOCTOR
Overall I-DOCTOR
for O
details O
of O
the O
procedure O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
floor O
in O
stable O
condition O
for O
observation O
, O
pain O
control O
and O
mobilization O
. O

Initially O
postoperatively O
, O
she O
was O
doing O
quite O
well O
, O
though O
she O
did O
require O
four O
liters O
of O
oxygen O
postoperatively O
to O
maintain O
her O
oxygen O
saturations O
. O

It O
was O
hoped O
that O
she O
would O
wean O
off O
the O
oxygen O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
hours O
. O

However O
, O
she O
did O
require O
four O
liters O
of O
oxygen O
all O
the O
way O
through O
the O
night O
to O
maintain O
oxygen O
saturations O
of O
93% O
. O

Without O
oxygen O
, O
she O
dropped O
down O
to O
the O
low O
80s O
. O

Given O
the O
unusual O
nature O
of O
this O
oxygen O
requirement O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
work-up O
with O
a O
chest O
X-ray O
, O
which O
essentially O
was O
normal O
. O

An O
ABG O
revealed O
a O
normal O
PCO2 O
of O
32 O
, O
but O
a O
decrease O
in O
PO2- O
at O
62 O
. O

Therefore O
, O
given O
her O
history O
of O
breast O
cancer O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
taken O
for O
a O
spiral O
CT O
scan O
and O
the O
Medicine O
Service O
was O
consulted O
at O
that O
time O
. O

They O
agreed O
with O
our O
plan O
. O

On O
spiral O
CT O
scan O
, O
a O
small O
pulmonary O
embolus O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
lobe O
and O
the O
left O
low O
er O
lobe O
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
heparin O
at O
that O
time O
to O
maintain O
a O
PTT O
of O
60 O
t O
o O
80 O
, O
and O
was O
given O
doses O
of O
Coumadin O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
Coumadin O
she O
had O
been O
given O
for O
DVT O
prophylaxis O
. O

With O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
medicine O
te O
am O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
maintain O
an O
INR O
of O
2 O
to O
3 O
with O
an O
overlap O
of O
heparin O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
therapeutic O
for O
two O
to O
three O
days O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
do O
quite O
well O
even O
though O
we O
did O
keep O
her O
on O
bed O
rest O
for O
three O
days O
while O
she O
was O
heparinized O
. O

Her O
oxygen O
saturations O
continued O
to O
improve O
to O
the O
point O
that O
she O
was O
on O
room O
air O
on O
postoperative O
day O
four O
with O
oxygen O
saturation O
of O
95% O
. O

She O
was O
given O
perioperative O
antibiotic O
prophylaxis O
for O
48 O
hours O
after O
surgery O
. O

She O
was O
mobilized O
on O
postoperative O
day O
four O
, O
getting O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
able O
to O
do O
quite O
well O
on O
her O
new O
hip O
with O
a O
minimal O
amount O
of O
pain O
. O

She O
was O
given O
posterior O
hip O
dislocation O
precautions O
at O
that O
time O
, O
which O
she O
understood O
quite O
well O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
medical O
team O
and O
was O
watched O
very O
closely O
by O
the O
orthopedic O
team O
until O
we O
felt O
comfortable O
that O
she O
was O
breathing O
quite O
well O
and O
was O
mobilizing O
well O
with O
physical O
therapy O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
at O
that O
time O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
ready O
for O
discharge O
to O
rehabilitation O
on O
Coumadin O
, O
which O
would O
be O
monitored O
for O
six O
months O
to O
maintain O
an O
INR O
of O
2.0 O
to O
3.0 O
. O

against O

A O
long O
discussion O
including O
Dr. O
Darlri B-DOCTOR
Kynetlandpryde I-DOCTOR
and O
the O
Haenlodstate B-HOSPITAL
Medical I-HOSPITAL
Center I-HOSPITAL
discussed O
with O
the O
patient O
the O
risks O
of O
leaving O
the O
hospital O
given O
a O
complete O
previa O
with O
several O
known O
bleeds O
in O
the O
past O
as O
well O
as O
instability O
. O

The O
patient O
understood O
all O
risks O
involved O
including O
significant O
maternal O
hemorrhage O
and O
poor O
fetal O
well O
being O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
these O
potentially O
serious O
risks O
to O
her O
and O
the O
baby O
she O
felt O
she O
wanted O
to O
be O
at O
home O
. O

We O
reminded O
her O
that O
even O
though O
she O
lives O
15 O
minutes O
away O
, O
if O
she O
stays O
in O
the O
hospital O
we O
can O
act O
faster O
to O
put O
in O
an O
iv O
, O
give O
her O
fluids O
and O
blood O
, O
and O
perform O
a O
c O
/ O
s O
if O
necessary O
than O
if O
she O
has O
to O
come O
in O
from O
home O
and O
those O
few O
minutes O
can O
make O
a O
difference O
between O
a O
good O
and O
bad O
outcome O
. O

She O
accepted O
these O
risks O
and O
opted O
to O
be O
discharged O
home O
today O
. O

She O
has O
offered O
that O
she O
has O
plenty O
of O
care O
at O
home O
including O
a O
housekeeper O
and O
will O
be O
able O
to O
remain O
on O
bed O
rest O
and O
live O
in O
Arvmelapho B-LOCATION
and O
knows O
to O
immediately O
come O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
any O
bleeding O
. O

She O
has O
family O
members O
who O
will O
be O
with O
her O
at O
home O
and O
will O
keep O
the O
phone O
number O
for O
the O
ambulance O
by O

. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
plan O
was O
for O
the O

to O
