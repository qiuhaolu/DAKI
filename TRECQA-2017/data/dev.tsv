1.8	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Uveitis: Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation. It affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea). Uveitis (u-vee-I-tis) warning signs often come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, pain and blurred vision. The condition can affect one or both eyes. It primarily affects people ages 20 to 50, but it may also affect children. Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Many times a cause can&apost be identified. Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent the complications of uveitis. The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis include: - Eye redness - Eye pain - Light sensitivity - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters) - Decreased vision Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. The choroid is sandwiched between the retina and the sclera. The retina is located at the inside wall of the eye and the sclera is the outer white part of the eye wall. The uvea provides blood flow to the deep layers of the retina. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed: - Iritis (anterior uveitis) affects the front of your eye and is the most common type. - Cyclitis (intermediate uveitis) affects the ciliary body. - Choroiditis and retinitis (posterior uveitis) affect the back of your eye. - Diffuse uveitis (panuveitis) occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed. In any of these conditions, the jelly-like material in the center of your eye (vitreous) can become inflamed and infiltrated with inflammatory cells. When to seek medical advice Contact your doctor if you think you have the warning signs of uveitis. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). If you&aposre having significant eye pain and unexpected vision problems, seek immediate medical attention. In about half of all cases, the specific cause of uveitis isn&apost clear. If a cause can be determined, it may be one of the following: - Eye injury or surgery - An autoimmune disorder, such as sarcoidosis or ankylosing spondylitis - An inflammatory disorder, such as Crohn&aposs disease or ulcerative colitis - An infection, such as cat-scratch disease, herpes zoster, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease or West Nile virus - A cancer that affects the eye, such as lymphoma People with changes in certain genes may be more likely to develop uveitis. In addition, a recent study shows a significant association between uveitis and cigarette smoking. When you visit an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), he or she will likely conduct a complete eye exam and gather a thorough health history. You may also need these tests: - Blood tests - Analysis of fluid from the eye - Photography to evaluate the retinal blood flow (angiography) - Photography to measure the thickness of the retinal tissue and to determine the presence or absence of fluid in or under the retina. If the ophthalmologist thinks an underlying condition may be the cause of your uveitis, you may be referred to another doctor for a general medical examination and laboratory tests. Sometimes, it&aposs difficult to find a specific cause for uveitis. However, your doctor will try to determine whether your uveitis is caused by an infection or another condition. If uveitis is caused by an underlying condition, treatment will focus on that specific condition. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation in your eye. Several treatment options are available. Medications - Drugs that reduce inflammation. Your doctor may first prescribe eyedrops with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. If those don&apost help, a corticosteroid pill or injection may be the next step. - Drugs that fight bacteria or viruses. If uveitis is caused by an infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, antiviral medications or other medicines, with or without corticosteroids, to bring the infection under control. - Drugs that affect the immune system or destroy cells. You may need immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs if your uveitis affects both eyes, doesn&apost respond well to corticosteroids or becomes severe enough to threaten your vision. Some of these medications can have serious side effects, such as glaucoma and cataracts. You may need to visit your doctor for follow-up examinations and blood tests every 1 to 3 months. Surgical and other procedures - Vitrectomy. Surgery to remove some of the vitreous in your eye (vitrectomy) may be necessary to manage the condition. - Surgery that implants a device into the eye to provide a slow and sustained release of a medication. For people with difficult-to-treat posterior uveitis, a device that&aposs implanted in the eye may be an option. This device slowly releases corticosteroid medication into the eye for two to three years. Possible side effects of this treatment include cataracts and glaucoma. The speed of your recovery depends in part on the type of uveitis you have and the severity of your symptoms. Uveitis that affects the back of your eye (choroiditis) tends to heal more slowly than uveitis in the front of the eye (iritis). Severe inflammation takes longer to clear up than mild inflammation does. Uveitis can come back. Make an appointment with your doctor if any of your symptoms reappear after successful treatment. Some alternative medicine treatments have anti-inflammatory properties, but they haven&apost been well-studied for the treatment of uveitis. Let your doctor know if you plan on using any alternative supplements or treatments, because some may interact with treatments you&aposre receiving or cause adverse reactions.
-0.6	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	What are Autoimmune Diseases?: Your body&aposs immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body. No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling. The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response.
0.7	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Facts About Uveitis (What is Uveitis?): Uveitis is a general term describing a group of inflammatory diseases that produces swelling and destroys eye tissues. These diseases can slightly reduce vision or lead to severe vision loss. The term “uveitis” is used because the diseases often affect a part of the eye called the uvea. Nevertheless, uveitis is not limited to the uvea. These diseases also affect the lens, retina, optic nerve, and vitreous, producing reduced vision or blindness. Uveitis may be caused by problems or diseases occurring in the eye or it can be part of an inflammatory disease affecting other parts of the body. It can happen at all ages and primarily affects people between 20 ñ 60 years old. Uveitis can last for a short (acute) or a long (chronic) time. The severest forms of uveitis reoccur many times. Eye care professionals may describe the disease more specifically as: - Anterior uveitis - Intermediate uveitis - Posterior uveitis - Panuveitis uveitis Eye care professionals may also describe the disease as infectious or noninfectious uveitis.
-1.7	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	autoimmune Addison disease: Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems. The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair. Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia). Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection. Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members can have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes. Addison disease affects approximately 11 to 14 in 100,000 people of European descent. The autoimmune form of the disorder is the most common form in developed countries, accounting for up to 90 percent of cases. The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition. The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body&aposs immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body&aposs own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person&aposs immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown. Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body&aposs own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease. Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes. A predisposition to develop autoimmune Addison disease is passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.

-1.8	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Autoimmune liver disease panel: An autoimmune liver disease panel is a group of tests that is done to check for autoimmune liver disease. An autoimmune liver disease means that the body&aposs immune system attacks the liver. These tests include: - Anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies - Anti-mitochondrial antibodies - Anti-nuclear antibodies - Anti-smooth muscle antibodies - Serum IgG The panel may also include other tests. Often, immune protein levels in the blood are also checked. A blood sample is taken from a vein. The blood sample is sent to the lab for testing. You do not need to take special steps before this test. You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Autoimmune disorders are a possible cause of liver disease. The most common of these diseases are autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis). This group of tests helps your health care provider diagnose liver disease. PROTEIN LEVELS: The normal range for protein levels in the blood will change with each laboratory. Please check with your provider for the normal ranges in your particular laboratory. ANTIBODIES: Negative results on all antibodies are normal. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Blood tests for autoimmune diseases are not wholly accurate. They can have false negative results (you have the disease, but the test is negative) and false positive results (you do not have the disease, but the test is positive). A weakly positive or low titer positive test for autoimmune disease is often not due to any disease. A positive test on the panel may be a sign of autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver disease. If the test is positive mostly for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, you are likely to have primary biliary cholangitis. If the immune proteins are high and albumin is low, you may have liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis. Slight risks from having blood drawn include: - Excessive bleeding - Fainting or feeling lightheaded - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Updated by: Michael M.

2.0	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Facts About Uveitis (What Causes Uveitis?): Uveitis is caused by inflammatory responses inside the eye. Inflammation is the body’s natural response to tissue damage, germs, or toxins. It produces swelling, redness, heat, and destroys tissues as certain white blood cells rush to the affected part of the body to contain or eliminate the insult. Uveitis may be caused by: - An attack from the body’s own immune system (autoimmunity). - Infections or tumors occurring within the eye or in other parts of the body. - Bruises to the eye. - Toxins that may penetrate the eye. The disease will cause symptoms, such as decreased vision, pain, light sensitivity, and increased floaters. In many cases the cause is unknown. Uveitis is usually classified by where it occurs in the eye.
-0.5	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Facts About Uveitis (What is Pan-Uveitis?): Pan-uveitis is a term used when all three major parts of the eye are affected by inflammation. Behcet’s disease is one of the most well-known forms of pan-uveitis and it greatly damages the retina. Intermediate, posterior, and pan-uveitis are the most severe and highly recurrent forms of uveitis. They often cause blindness if left untreated.
-0.4	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Autoimmune diseases (How do I find out if I have an autoimmune disease?): Getting a diagnosis can be a long and stressful process. Although each autoimmune disease is unique, many share some of the same symptoms. And many symptoms of autoimmune diseases are the same for other types of health problems too. This makes it hard for doctors to find out if you really have an autoimmune disease, and which one it might be. But if you are having symptoms that bother you, it&aposs important to find the cause. Don&apost give up if you&aposre not getting any answers. You can take these steps to help find out the cause of your symptoms:
-1.9	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Insulin autoimmune syndrome: Insulin autoimmune syndrome is a rare condition that causes low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia). This occurs because the body begins to make a specific kind of protein called antibodies to attack insulin. Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for keeping blood sugar at a normal level. When blood sugar levels get too high, insulin helps to store the sugar for future use. People affected by insulin autoimmune syndrome have antibodies that attack insulin, causing it to work too hard and the level of blood sugar to become too low. Insulin autoimmune syndrome most often begins during adulthood. [1] [2] The symptoms of insulin autoimmune syndrome are similar to those of other disorders that cause low blood sugar . These symptoms include sweating, fainting, lightheadedness, weakness, and fatigue. If a person has symptoms of insulin autoimmune syndrome for a long time, the high levels of insulin can begin to attack the pancreas, which can cause damage to the organ . [3] [4]   Insulin autoimmune syndrome occurs suddenly as antibodies are produced that attack the insulin which the body is producing naturally. Because a person affected by this condition is producing antibodies to attack a naturally occurring substance, the condition is classified as a type of autoimmune syndrome. This means that the immune system , which is responsible for protecting the body from disease, is instead attacking the body itself. [1] Exactly why these antibodies against insulin are suddenly produced can vary from person to person. In some cases, insulin autoimmune syndrome occurs in a person with another autoimmune disease , which can indicate that the immune system in the body is not behaving correctly. Additionally, a certain class of medications called sulphydryl compounds have been shown to sometimes cause insulin autoimmune syndrome. Some of these medications are used to treat other autoimmune conditions. Recently, a compound called alpha-lipoic acid has been associated with an increased risk of developing insulin autoimmune syndrome. This compound is sometimes used for dieting purposes. [5]  Insulin autoimmune syndrome may be diagnosed by measuring blood sugar levels, insulin levels, and ruling out other conditions that can cause low blood sugar . Certain tests may also be used to test for the presence of antibodies that attack insulin. All of these tests can be completed using blood from a blood test. [6]  The treatment of insulin autoimmune syndrome is similar to treatments for other conditions that cause low blood sugar . This includes eating smaller meals more frequently in order to maintain a more consistent blood sugar level and continuous monitoring of blood sugar. Additional treatment options can include treatment with steroids and a procedure called plasmaphoresis which removes the blood from the body, separates the insulin antibodies in the blood stream, and replaces the blood without the antibodies. Any damage to the pancreas may also require treatment. [7] [8]  Most people affected by insulin autoimmune syndrome find that their symptoms go away after a few months. It may be important to stop taking any medications that may be triggering the condition. Some people, however, do experience recurrent attacks where they experience low blood sugar levels. With proper treatment, any recurrent episodes can likely be controlled. [2] 
1.9	about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?	Uveitis: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body&aposs immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriasis - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sarcoidosis - Ulcerative colitis Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as: - AIDS - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis - Herpes zoster infection - Histoplasmosis - Kawasaki disease - Syphilis - Toxoplasmosis - Tuberculosis Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it most often only affects the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people. Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Changes involve the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis. Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include: - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in the vision - Eye pain - Redness of the eye - Sensitivity to light The health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system. If you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will rule out multiple sclerosis. Iritis (anterior uveitis) is most often mild. Treatment may involve: - Dark glasses - Eye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain - Steroid eye drops Pars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system. Posterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause. It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide (systemic) infection, you may be given antibiotics. You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. With proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, the problem often returns. Posterior uveitis may last from months to years. It may cause permanent vision damage, even with treatment. Complications may include: - Cataracts - Fluid within the retina - Glaucoma - Irregular pupil - Retinal detachment - Vision loss Symptoms that need urgent medical care are: - Eye pain - Reduced vision If you have a body-wide (systemic) infection or disease, treating the condition will prevent uveitis.

-0.5	achalasia. after surgery for achalasia, will spasms continue in the upper chest area and if so what can assist in ending spasms	Triple A syndrome (Treatment): There is no cure for triple A syndrome at this time; treatment typically focuses on managing individual signs and symptoms of the condition. Glucocorticoid deficiency in individuals with known adrenal insufficiency (present with Addison disease) is typically treated by replacement of glucocorticoids. This may be important for avoiding an adrenal crisis and allowing for normal growth in children. In adult individuals, as well as those who have difficulty with compliance, replacing hydrocortisone with prednisone or dexamethasone is sometimes recommended. It is usually recommended that affected individuals wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace and carry the emergency medical information card supplied with it. Achalasia is typically managed with surgical correction. Individuals may be monitored for pulmonary complications (due to reflux and aspiration). Gastric acid reduction therapy in individuals with reflux after surgical intervention is usually recommended. The symptoms in individuals with achalasia may be improved partially with pneumatic dilatation (also called balloon dilation). For those who remain symptomatic after this, other surgeries may be recommended. Alacrima is typically managed by applying topical lubricants (such as artificial tears or ointments), and with punctal occlusion (a procedure used to close the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye). The symptoms of alacrima typically improve with punctal occlusion. However, this procedure is usually only done when therapy with topical lubricants is unsuccessful. [1]
1.9	achalasia. after surgery for achalasia, will spasms continue in the upper chest area and if so what can assist in ending spasms	Achalasia (Treatment): Achalasia treatment focuses on relaxing or forcing open the lower esophageal sphincter so that food and liquid can move more easily through your digestive tract. Specific treatment depends on your age and the severity of the condition. Nonsurgical treatment Nonsurgical options include: - Pneumatic dilation. A balloon is inserted into the esophageal sphincter and inflated to enlarge the opening. This outpatient procedure may need to be repeated if the esophageal sphincter doesn&apost stay open. Nearly one-third of people treated with balloon dilation need repeat treatment within six years. - Botox (botulinum toxin type A). This muscle relaxant can be injected directly into the esophageal sphincter with an endoscope. The injections may need to be repeated, and repeat injections may make it more difficult to perform surgery later if needed. Botox is generally recommended only for people who aren&apost good candidates for pneumatic dilation or surgery due to age or overall health. - Medication. Your doctor might suggest muscle relaxants such as nitroglycerin (Nitrostat) or nifedipine (Procardia) before eating. These medications have limited treatment effect and severe side effects. Medications are generally considered only if you&aposre not a candidate for pneumatic dilation or surgery, and Botox hasn&apost helped. Surgery Surgery may be recommended for younger people because nonsurgical treatment tends to be less effective in this group. Surgical options include: - Heller myotomy. The surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter to allow food to pass more easily into the stomach. The procedure can be done noninvasively (laparoscopic Heller myotomy). People who have a Heller myotomy may later develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). - Fundoplication. The surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent acid reflux. Fundoplication might be performed at the same time as Heller myotomy, to avoid future problems with acid reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. - Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The surgeon uses an endoscope inserted through your mouth and down your throat to create an incision in the inside lining of your esophagus. Then, as in a Heller myotomy, the surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter. POEM doesn&apost include an anti-reflux procedure.
1.8	achalasia. after surgery for achalasia, will spasms continue in the upper chest area and if so what can assist in ending spasms	Idiopathic achalasia: Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It is characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, impaired ability of the esophagus to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), and failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus (the lower esophageal sphincter) to relax. [1] Achalasia is typically diagnosed in individuals between 25 and 60 years of age. The exact etiology is unknown, however, symptoms are caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. [2] Familial studies have shown evidence of a potential genetic influence. When a genetic influence is suspected, achalasia is called familial esophageal achalasia. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter and may include Botox, medications, or surgery. [3] Most people with achalasia experience difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia  and heartburn. Other symptoms might include: regurgitation or vomiting, noncardiac chest pain, odynophagia (painful swallowing), and pain in the upper central region of the abdomen. Non esophageal symptoms might include: coughing or asthma, chronic aspiration (breathing a foreign object such as food into the airway), hoarseness or sore throat, and unintentional weight loss. [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Achalasia Very frequent The lower esophageal sphincter, the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, normally relaxes during swallowing. In people with achalasia, this muscle ring does not relax as well. [4] The reason for this problem is damage to the nerves of the esophagus. [4] [5] In some people, this problem appears to be inherited . [4] There is additionally a suspected autoimmune component involved in the development of achalasia as individuals with achalasia are more likely to have a concomitant autoimmune disease than the general population. [3]  Achalasia is suspected in individuals with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and in instances where regurgitation symptoms are not responsive to protein pump inhibitor medication.  The diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed by manometry (test that measures how well the esophagus is working); however, other tests such as upper endoscopy and upper GI X-ray can additionally be useful. [4] [2] The aim of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter. Therapy may involve: [4] [6] [5] Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) to help relax the sphincter muscles (used as a temporary fix)  Medications, such as long-acting nitrates (i.e. isosorbide dinitrate) or calcium channel blockers (i.e. nifedipine), to relax the lower esophagus sphincter Surgery (Heller myotomy) to decrease the pressure in the lower sphincter Pneumatic balloon dilation of the esophagus at the location of the narrowing (done during esophagogastroduodenoscopy) You can learn more about these treatment options by clicking on the following links: eMedicine Esophageal Motility Disorders Merck Manuals Motility Disorders A doctor should help to determine the best treatment for each individual situation. [4] Although there is no cure for achalasia, treatment options are estimated to be effective in 90% of cases. Without treatment, individuals with achalasia develop progressive dilation of the esophagus. This then leads to late or end-stage achalasia, characterized by esophageal tortuosity (twisting and turning), angulation, and severe dilation. Approximately 10-15% of individuals who have undergone treatment will progress to late or end-stage achalasia. Treatment for late or end-stage achalasia is typically esophagectomy (surgery to remove all or part of the esophagus). [2] [7]

Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach. There is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as well. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced. This problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Other problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes Chagas disease. Achalasia is rare. It may occur at any age, but is most common in middle-aged or older adults. In some people, the problem may be inherited. Symptoms include: - Backflow (regurgitation) of food - Chest pain, which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms - Cough - Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids - Heartburn - Unintentional weight loss Physical exam may show signs of anemia or malnutrition. Tests include: - Manometry, a test to measure how well the esophagus is working. - EGD or upper endoscopy, a test to examine the lining of the stomach and esophagus. It uses a flexible tube and camera. - Upper GI x-ray. The goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve: - Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox). This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the benefit wears off within a few weeks or months. - Medicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers. These drugs can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. - Surgery (called a myotomy). In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. - Widening (dilation) of the esophagus at the location of the narrowing. This is done during EGD. Your health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you. The outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar. More than one treatment is sometimes necessary. Complications may include: - Backflow (regurgitation) of acid or food from the stomach into the esophagus (reflux) - Breathing food contents into the lungs (aspiration), which can cause pneumonia - Tearing (perforation) of the esophagus Call your provider if: - You have trouble swallowing or painful swallowing - Your symptoms continue, even with treatment for achalasia Many of the causes of achalasia cannot be prevented. However, treatment may help to prevent complications. Updated by: Subodh K. Lal, MD, gastroenterologist at Gastrointestinal Specialists of Georgia, Austell, GA.

-0.7	achalasia. after surgery for achalasia, will spasms continue in the upper chest area and if so what can assist in ending spasms	Idiopathic achalasia (Cause): The lower esophageal sphincter, the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, normally relaxes during swallowing. In people with achalasia, this muscle ring does not relax as well. [4] The reason for this problem is damage to the nerves of the esophagus. [4] [5] In some people, this problem appears to be inherited . [4] There is additionally a suspected autoimmune component involved in the development of achalasia as individuals with achalasia are more likely to have a concomitant autoimmune disease than the general population.

They do not help to treat the irritation in your esophagus. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation. Other over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids but give you longer relief. Your provider can tell you how to take these drugs. There are two different types of these drugs: H2 antagonists: famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid) Proton pump inhibitors (PPI): omeprazole (Prilosec or Zegarid), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and pantoprazole (Protonix)
2.0	Ankle injury. I got hurt in my left leg ankle almost 5 months ago. I went to doctor, got x-ray, where no damage was found. He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.	Ankle pain: Ankle pain involves any discomfort in one or both ankles. Ankle pain is often due to an ankle sprain. - An ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments, which connect bones to one another. - In most cases, the ankle is twisted inward, causing small tears in the ligaments. The tearing leads to swelling and bruising, making it difficult to bear weight on the joint. In addition to ankle sprains, ankle pain can be caused by: - Damage or swelling of tendons (which join muscles to bone) or cartilage (which cushions joints) - Infection in the ankle joint - Osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, and other types of arthritis Problems in areas near the ankle that can cause you to feel pain in the ankle include: - Blockage of blood vessels in the leg - Heel pain or injuries - Nerve injuries (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or sciatica) Home care for ankle pain depends on the cause and what other treatment or surgery has taken place. You may be asked to: - Rest your ankle for several days. Try to NOT put much weight on your ankle. - Put on an ACE bandage. You also can buy a brace that supports your ankle. - Use crutches or a cane to help take the weight off a sore or unsteady ankle. - Keep your foot raised above the level of your heart. When you are sitting or sleeping, place two pillows under your ankle. - Ice the area right away. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day. Then, apply ice every 3 to 4 hours for 2 more days. - Try acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other pain relievers made by the store. As the swelling and pain improve, you may still need to keep extra weight stress off your ankle for a period of time. The injury may take a few weeks to many months to fully heal. Once the pain and swelling are mostly gone, the injured ankle will still be a little weaker and less stable than the uninjured ankle. - You will need to start exercises to strengthen your ankle and avoid injury in the future. - DO NOT begin these exercises until a health care professional tells you it is safe to start. - You will also need to work on your balance and agility. Other advice your health care provider may give you include: - Lose weight if you are overweight. Extra weight puts strain on your ankles. - Warm up before exercising. Stretch the muscles and tendons that support the ankle. - Avoid sports and activities for which you are not properly conditioned. - Make sure that shoes fit you properly. Avoid high-heeled shoes. - If you are prone to ankle pain or twisting your ankle during certain activities, use ankle support braces. These include air casts, ACE bandages, or lace-up ankle supports. - Work on your balance and do agility exercises. Go to the hospital if: - You have severe pain even when you are NOT bearing weight. - You suspect a broken bone (the joint looks deformed and you cannot put any weight on the leg). - You can hear a popping sound and have immediate pain of the joint. - You can&apost move your ankle back and forth. Call your provider if: - Swelling does not go down within 2 to 3 days. - You have symptoms of infection. The area becomes red, more painful, or warm, or you have a fever over 100°F (37.7°C). - The pain does not go away after several weeks. - Other joints are also involved. - You have a history of arthritis and are having new symptoms.

Heel pain (What to Expect at Your Office Visit): Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as: - Have you had this type of heel pain before? - When did your pain begin? - Do you have pain upon your first steps in the morning or after your first steps after rest? - Is the pain dull and aching or sharp and stabbing? - Is it worse after exercise? - Is it worse when standing? - Did you fall or twist your ankle recently? - Are you a runner? If so, how far and how often do you run? - Do you walk or stand for long periods of time? - What kind of shoes do you wear? - Do you have any other symptoms? Your provider may order a foot x-ray. You may need to see a physical therapist to learn exercises to stretch and strengthen your foot. Your provider may recommend a night splint to help stretch your foot. At times, further imaging, like CT scan or MRI may be needed. Surgery may be recommended in some cases.

You may also have back stiffness, decreased movement of the lower back, and difficulty standing straight. Acute back pain can last for a few days to a few weeks. Most people have at least one backache in their life. Although this pain or discomfort can happen anywhere in your back, the most common area affected is your lower back. This is because the lower back supports most of your body&aposs weight. Low back pain is the number two reason that Americans see their health care provider. It is second only to colds and flu. You will usually first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident. Acute low back pain is most often caused by a sudden injury to the muscles and ligaments supporting the back. The pain may be caused by muscle spasms or a strain or tear in the muscles and ligaments. Causes of sudden low back pain include: - Compression fractures to the spine from osteoporosis - Cancer involving the spine - Fracture of the spinal cord - Muscle spasm (very tense muscles) - Ruptured or herniated disk - Sciatica - Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) - Spine curvatures (like scoliosis or kyphosis), which may be inherited and seen in children or teens - Strain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back Low back pain may also be due to: - An abnormal aortic aneurysm that is leaking - Arthritis conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis - Infection of the spine (osteomyelitis, diskitis, abscess) - Kidney infection or kidney stones - Problems related to pregnancy - Medical conditions that affect the female reproductive organs, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids You may feel a variety of symptoms if you have hurt your back. You may have a tingling or burning sensation, a dull achy feeling, or sharp pain. The pain may be mild, or it can be so severe that you are unable to move. Depending on the cause of your back pain, you may also have pain in your leg, hip, or the bottom of your foot. You may also have weakness in your legs and feet. When you first see your provider, you will be asked about your back pain, including how often it happens and how severe it is. Your provider will try to determine the cause of your back pain and whether it is likely to quickly get better with simple measures such as ice, mild painkillers, physical therapy, and proper exercises. Most of the time, back pain will get better using these methods. During the physical exam, your provider will try to pinpoint the location of the pain and figure out how it affects your movement. Most people with back pain improve or recover within 4 to 6 weeks. Your provider may not order any tests during the first visit unless you have certain symptoms. Tests that might be ordered include: - X-ray - CT scan of the lower spine - MRI of the lower spine To get better quickly, take the right measures when you first feel pain. Here are some tips for how to handle pain: - Stop normal physical activity for the first few days. This will help relieve your symptoms and reduce any swelling in the area of the pain. - Apply heat or ice to the painful area. One good method is to use ice for the first 48 to 72 hours, and then use heat. - Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount. While sleeping, try lying in a curled-up, fetal position with a pillow between your legs. If you usually sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees to relieve pressure. A common misbelief about back pain is that you need to rest and avoid activity for a long time. In fact, bed rest is not recommended. If you have no sign of a serious cause for your back pain (such as loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, weight loss, or fever), then you should stay as active as possible. You may want to reduce your activity only for the first couple of days. Then, slowly start your usual activities after that. Do not perform activities that involve heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins. After 2 to 3 weeks, you should gradually start exercising again. - Begin with light aerobic activity. Walking, riding a stationary bicycle, and swimming are great examples. These activities can improve blood flow to your back and promote healing. They also strengthen muscles in your stomach and back. - You may benefit from physical therapy. Your provider will determine whether you need to see a physical therapist and can refer you to one. The physical therapist will first use methods to reduce your pain. Then, the therapist will teach you ways to prevent getting back pain again. - Stretching and strengthening exercises are important. But, starting these exercises too soon after an injury can make your pain worse. A physical therapist can tell you when to begin stretching and strengthening exercises and how to do them. If your pain lasts longer than 1 month, your primary provider may send you to see either an orthopedist (bone specialist) or neurologist (nerve specialist). If your pain has not improved after use of medicines, physical therapy, and other treatments, your provider may recommend an epidural injection. You may also see: - A massage therapist - Someone who performs acupuncture - Someone who does spinal manipulation (a chiropractor, osteopathic doctor, or physical therapist) Sometimes, a few visits to these specialists will help back pain. Many people feel better within 1 week. After another 4 to 6 weeks, the back pain should be completely gone. Call your provider right away if you have: - Back pain after a severe blow or fall - Burning with urination or blood in your urine - History of cancer - Loss of control over urine or stool (incontinence) - Pain traveling down your legs below the knee - Pain that is worse when you lie down or pain that wakes you up at night - Redness or swelling on the back or spine - Severe pain that does not allow you to get comfortable - Unexplained fever with back pain - Weakness or numbness in your buttocks, thigh, leg, or pelvis Also call if: - You have been losing weight unintentionally - You use steroids or intravenous drugs - You have had back pain before, but this episode is different and feels worse - This episode of back pain has lasted longer than 4 weeks There are many things you can do to lower your chances of getting back pain. Exercise is important for preventing back pain. Through exercise you can: - Improve your posture - Strengthen your back and improve flexibility - Lose weight - Avoid falls It is also very important to learn to lift and bend properly. Follow these tips: - If an object is too heavy or awkward, get help. - Spread your feet apart to give your body a wide base of support when lifting. - Stand as close as possible to the object you are lifting. - Bend at your knees, not at your waist. - Tighten your stomach muscles as you lift the object or lower it down. - Hold the object as close to your body as you can. - Lift using your leg muscles. - As you stand up with the object, do not bend forward. - Do not twist while you are bending down for the object, lifting it up, or carrying it. Other measures to prevent back pain include: - Avoid standing for long periods. If you must stand for your work, alternate resting each foot on a stool. - Do not wear high heels. Use cushioned soles when walking. - When sitting for work, especially if you are using a computer, make sure your chair has a straight back with an adjustable seat and back, armrests, and a swivel seat. - Use a stool under your feet while sitting so that your knees are higher than your hips. - Place a small pillow or rolled towel behind your lower back while sitting or driving for long periods. - If you drive a long distance, stop and walk around every hour. Bring your seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending. Do not lift heavy objects just after a ride. - Quit smoking. - Lose weight. - Do exercises on a regular basis to strengthen your abdominal and core muscles. This will strengthen your core to decrease the risk for further injuries. - Learn to relax. Try methods such as yoga, tai chi, or massage. Updated by: C.

Your heel may become tender or swollen from: - Shoes with poor support or shock absorption - Running on hard surfaces, like concrete - Running too often - Tightness in your calf muscle or the Achilles tendon - Sudden inward or outward turning of your heel - Landing hard or awkwardly on the heel Conditions that may cause heel pain include: - Swelling and pain in the Achilles tendon - Swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone under the Achilles tendon (bursitis) - Bone spurs in the heel - Swelling of the thick band of tissue on the bottom of your foot (plantar fasciitis) - Fracture of the heel bone that is related to landing very hard on your heel from a fall (calcaneus fracture) The following steps may help relieve your heel pain: - Use crutches to take weight off your feet. - Rest as much as possible for at least a week. - Apply ice to the painful area. Do this at least twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes. Ice more often in the first couple of days. - Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the pain. - Wear well-fitted shoes. - Use a heel cup, felt pads in the heel area, or shoe insert. - Wear night splints. Your health care provider may recommend other treatments, depending on the cause of your heel pain. Maintaining flexible and strong muscles in your calves, ankles, and feet can help prevent some types of heel pain. Always stretch and warm-up before exercising. Wear comfortable and well-fitting shoes with good arch support and cushioning. Make sure there is enough room for your toes. Call your provider if your heel pain does not get better after 2 to 3 weeks of home treatment. Also call if: - Your pain is getting worse despite home treatment - Your pain is sudden and severe - You have redness or swelling of your heel - You cannot put weight on your foot Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as: - Have you had this type of heel pain before? - When did your pain begin? - Do you have pain upon your first steps in the morning or after your first steps after rest? - Is the pain dull and aching or sharp and stabbing? - Is it worse after exercise? - Is it worse when standing? - Did you fall or twist your ankle recently? - Are you a runner?

Here are some common causes of knee pain: MEDICAL CONDITIONS Arthritis. Including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, lupus, and gout. Baker cyst. A fluid-filled swelling behind the knee that may occur with swelling (inflammation) from other causes, like arthritis. Cancers that either spread to your bones or begin in the bones. Osgood-Schlatter disease. Infection in the bones of the knee. Infection in the knee joint. INJURIES AND OVERUSE Bursitis. Inflammation from repeated pressure on the knee, such as kneeling for a long time, overuse, or injury. Dislocation of the kneecap. Fracture of the kneecap or other bones. Iliotibial band syndrome. Injury to the thick band that runs from your hip to the outside of your knee. Pain in the front of your knee around the kneecap. Torn ligament. An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, or medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury may cause bleeding into your knee, swelling, or an unstable knee. Torn cartilage (a meniscus tear). Pain felt on the inside or outside of the knee joint. Strain or sprain. Minor injuries to the ligaments caused by sudden or unnatural twisting.

The SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells and play a key role in a cell&aposs ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. The NaV1.7 channel is also found in olfactory sensory neurons, which are nerve cells in the nasal cavity that transmit smell-related signals to the brain. The SCN9A gene mutations that cause congenital insensitivity to pain result in the production of nonfunctional alpha subunits that cannot be incorporated into NaV1.7 channels. As a result, the channels cannot be formed. The absence of NaV1.7 channels impairs the transmission of pain signals from the site of injury to the brain, causing those affected to be insensitive to pain. Loss of this channel in olfactory sensory neurons likely impairs the transmission of smell-related signals to the brain, leading to anosmia.

This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called "referred" pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear
1.9	Body Lice. How do I get rid of these little devils? Me and My mom have tried so many things to get rid of these bugs and they just don&apost go away were the family that takes 2 showers and now about 3 showers a day we never understood how they could have infected us but I was just wondering is washing our clothes the best bet to get rid of these things, because apparently it hasn&apost worked for us. So is there any suggestions?	Body lice: Body lice are tiny insects, about the size of a sesame seed. Body lice live in your clothing and bedding and travel to your skin several times a day to feed on blood. The most common sites for bites are around the neck, shoulders, armpits, waist and groin - places where clothing seams are most likely to touch skin. Body lice are most common in crowded and unhygienic living conditions, such as refugee camps and shelters for the homeless. Body lice bites can spread certain types of diseases and can even cause epidemics. Clothing and bedding that have been infested with body lice should be laundered in hot, soapy water and machine dried using the hot cycle. Body lice bites can cause intense itching, and you may notice small areas of blood and crust on your skin at the site of the bite marks. See your doctor if improved hygiene doesn&apost eliminate the infestation, or if you develop a skin infection from scratching the bites. Body lice are similar to head lice, but have different habits. While head lice live in your hair and feed on your scalp, body lice typically live in your clothes and bedding. They travel to your skin several times a day to feed on blood. The seams of your clothing are the most common places for body lice to lay their eggs (nits). You can become infested with body lice if you come into close contact with a person who has body lice, or with clothing or bedding that is infested with body lice. People who are at higher risk of body lice tend to live in crowded, unclean conditions. They include: - War refugees - Homeless people - Victims of natural disasters Dogs, cats and other pets do not spread body lice. Body lice infestations usually cause minimal problems. However, a body lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as: - Secondary infections. When body lice scratch and dig to feed on your blood, they may irritate your skin. If you scratch to alleviate itching, this also can irritate your skin. If your skin becomes raw from these irritations, other infections may develop. - Skin changes. If you&aposre infested with body lice for a long time, you may experience skin changes such as thickening and discoloration - particularly around your waist, groin or upper thighs. - Spread of disease. Body lice can carry and spread some bacterial diseases, such as typhus, relapsing fever or trench fever. You or your doctor can usually confirm a body lice infestation through a visual examination of your body and clothing items. The presence of eggs and moving lice confirms infestation. Body lice are primarily treated by thoroughly washing yourself and any contaminated items with soap and hot water. Dry cleaning and ironing clothing that cannot be washed is also effective. If these measures don&apost work, you can try using an over-the-counter lotion or shampoo - such as Nix or Rid. If that still doesn&apost work, your doctor can provide a prescription lotion. Lice-killing products can be toxic to humans, so follow the directions carefully. You can usually get rid of body lice by cleaning yourself and any personal belongings that may be contaminated. Wash infested bedding, clothing and towels with hot, soapy water - at least 130 F (54 C) - and machine dry them on high heat for at least 20 minutes. Clothing that can&apost be washed may be dry cleaned and ironed. Items that can&apost be washed should be sealed in a plastic bag and stored in a warm area for two weeks. Mattresses, couches and other upholstered furniture items should be hot ironed or sprayed with lice-killing products to eliminate eggs from seams. Exposure to infested items should be avoided for two weeks.

So is there any suggestions?	Body lice (Complications): Body lice infestations usually cause minimal problems. However, a body lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as: - Secondary infections. When body lice scratch and dig to feed on your blood, they may irritate your skin. If you scratch to alleviate itching, this also can irritate your skin. If your skin becomes raw from these irritations, other infections may develop. - Skin changes. If you&aposre infested with body lice for a long time, you may experience skin changes such as thickening and discoloration - particularly around your waist, groin or upper thighs. - Spread of disease. Body lice can carry and spread some bacterial diseases, such as typhus, relapsing fever or trench fever.

Lice found on each area of the body are different from each other. The three types of lice that live on humans are head lice, body lice (also called clothes lice), and pubic lice ("crabs"). Symptoms of lice may include - Intense itching - Rash - Visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice Lice spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. Lice move by crawling. They cannot hop or fly. If you get lice, both over-the-counter and prescription medicines are available for treatment.

So is there any suggestions?	Back Pain (Who gets it? Who gets back pain?): Anyone can have back pain, but some things that increase your risk are: Getting older. Back pain is more common the older you get. You may first have back pain when you are 30 to 40 years old. Poor physical fitness. Back pain is more common in people who are not fit. Being overweight. A diet high in calories and fat can make you gain weight. Too much weight can stress the back and cause pain. Heredity. Genes play a role in some causes of back pain, such as certain types of arthritis. Other diseases. Some types of arthritis and cancer can cause back pain. Your job. If you have to lift, push, or pull while twisting your spine, you may get back pain. If you work at a desk all day and do not sit up straight, you may also get back pain. Smoking. Your body may not be able to get enough nutrients to the disks in your back if you smoke. Smoker&aposs cough may also cause back pain. People who smoke are slow to heal, so back pain may last longer. Race. Black women are two to three times more likely than white women to have part of the lower spine slip out of place.There are two types of back pain: Acute pain is pain that hits you suddenly after an accident, a fall, or lifting something heavy. Acute pain is the most common type of back pain and lasts no longer than 6 weeks. Chronic pain may come on either quickly or slowly and lasts a long time, generally longer than 3 months. This type of back pain is much less common.Anyone can have back pain, but some things that increase your risk are: Getting older. Back pain is more common the older you get.

So is there any suggestions?	Head lice (Causes): Head lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair look like flakes of dandruff. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place. Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks. Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions. You can get head lice if: You come in close contact with a person who has lice. You touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice. You share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice. Having head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases. Having head lice does NOT mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.

Hello I burnt my wrist 2 days ago and after last night ive woken up with a swollen had its really noticeable to other people but I ca feel the skin has gone tight when I put it against the other hand you can see its bigger what should I do about this?	Burns: Burns commonly occur by direct or indirect contact with heat, electric current, radiation, or chemical agents. Burns can lead to cell death. There are 3 levels of burns: - First-degree burns affect only the outer layer of the skin. They cause pain, redness, and swelling. - Second-degree burns affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin. They cause pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns. - Third-degree burns affect the deep layers of skin. They are also called full thickness burns. They cause white or blackened, burned skin. The skin may be numb. Burns fall into 2 groups. Minor burns are: - First degree burns anywhere on the body - Second degree burns less than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) wide  Major burns include: - Third-degree burns - Second-degree burns more than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) wide - Second-degree burns on the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or over a major joint You can have more than 1 type of burn at a time. Severe burns need urgent medical care. This can help prevent scarring, disability, and deformity. Burns on the face, hands, feet, and genitals can be particularly serious. Children under age 4 and adults over age 60 have a higher chance of complications and death from severe burns because their skin tends to be thinner than in other age groups. Causes of burns from most to least common are: - Fire/flame - Scalding from steam or hot liquids - Touching hot objects - Electrical burns - Chemical burns Burns can be the result of any of the following: - House and industrial fires - Car accidents - Playing with matches - Faulty space heaters, furnaces, or industrial equipment - Unsafe use of firecrackers and other fireworks - Kitchen accidents, such as a child grabbing a hot iron or touching the stove You can also burn your airways if you breathe in smoke, steam, superheated air, or chemical fumes in poorly ventilated areas. Burn symptoms can include: - Blisters that are either intact (unbroken) or have ruptured and are leaking fluid - Pain (How much pain you have is unrelated to the level of burn. The most serious burns can be painless.) - Peeling skin - Shock (Watch for pale and clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and a drop in alertness.) - Swelling - Red, white, or charred skin If you have burned your airways, you may have: - Burns on the head, face, neck, eyebrows, or nose hairs - Burned lips and mouth - Coughing - Difficulty breathing - Dark, black-stained mucus - Voice changes - Wheezing Before giving first aid, it is important to determine what type of burn the person has. If you are not sure, treat it as a major burn. Serious burns need medical care right away. Call your local emergency number or 911. MINOR BURNS If the skin is unbroken: - Run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area under water for at least 5 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will help reduce pain. - Calm and reassure the person. - After flushing or soaking the burn, cover it with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing. - Protect the burn from pressure and friction. - Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. Do NOT give aspirin to children under 12. - Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion also can help. Minor burns will often heal without further treatment. Make sure the person is up to date on their tetanus immunization. MAJOR BURNS If someone is on fire, tell the person to stop, drop, and roll. Then, follow these steps: - Wrap the person in thick material; such as a wool or cotton coat, rug, or blanket. This helps put out the flames. - Pour water on the person. - Call 911 or your local emergency number. - Make sure that the person is no longer touching any burning or smoking materials. - Do NOT remove burned clothing that is stuck to the skin. - Make sure the person is breathing. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR. - Cover the burn area with a dry sterile bandage (if available) or clean cloth. A sheet will do if the burned area is large. Do NOT apply any ointments. Avoid breaking burn blisters. - If fingers or toes have been burned, separate them with dry, sterile, non-sticky bandage. - Raise the body part that is burned above the level of the heart. - Protect the burn area from pressure and friction. - If an electrical injury may have caused the burn, DO NOT touch the victim directly. Use a non-metallic object to move the person away from exposed wires before starting first aid. You will also need to prevent shock. If the person does not have a head, neck, back, or leg injury, follow these steps: - Lay the person flat - Raise the feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters) - Cover the person with a coat or blanket Continue to monitor the person&aposs pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure until medical help arrives. Things that should not be done for burns include: - Do NOT apply ointment, butter, ice, medicines, cream, oil spray, or any household remedy to a severe burn. - Do NOT breathe, blow, or cough on the burn. - Do NOT disturb blistered or dead skin. - Do NOT remove clothing that is stuck to the skin. - Do NOT give the person anything by mouth, if there is a severe burn. - Do NOT place a severe burn in cold water. This can cause shock. - Do NOT place a pillow under the person&aposs head if there is an airways burn. This can close the airways. Call 911 or your local emergency number if: - The burn is very large, about the size of your palm or larger. - The burn is severe (third degree). - You aren&apost sure how serious it is. - The burn is caused by chemicals or electricity. - The person shows signs of shock. - The person breathed in smoke. - Physical abuse is the known or suspected cause of the burn. - There are other symptoms associated with the burn. For minor burns, call your health care provider if you still have pain after 48 hours. Call a provider right away if signs of infection develop. These signs include: - Drainage or pus from the burned skin - Fever - Increased pain - Red streaks spreading from the burn - Swollen lymph nodes Also call a provider right away if symptoms of dehydration occur with a burn: - Decreased urination - Dizziness - Dry skin - Headache - Lightheadedness - Nausea (with or without vomiting) - Thirst Children, older people, and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, from HIV) should be seen right away. The provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as needed. These may include: - Airway and breathing support, including a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, or breathing machine (ventilator) for serious burns or those involving the face or airway - Blood and urine tests if shock or other complications are present - Chest x-ray for face or airway burns - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing), if shock or other complications are present - Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein), if shock or other complications are present - Medicines for pain relief and to prevent infection - Ointments or creams applied to the burned areas - Tetanus immunization, if not up to date The outcome will depend on the type (degree), extent, and location of the burn. It also depends upon whether internal organs have been affected, and if other trauma has occurred. Burns can leave permanent scars. They can also be more sensitive to temperature and light than normal skin. Sensitive areas, such as the eyes, nose, or ears, may be badly injured and have lost normal function. With airway burns, the person may have less breathing capacity and permanent lung damage. Severe burns that affect the joints may result in contractures, leaving the joint with decreased movement and a reduction in function. To help prevent burns: - Install smoke alarms in your home. Check and change batteries regularly. - Teach children about fire safety and the danger of matches and fireworks. - Keep children from climbing on top of a stove or grabbing hot items such as irons and oven doors. - Turn pot handles toward the back of the stove so that children can&apost grab them and they can&apost accidentally be knocked over. - Place fire extinguishers in key locations at home, work, and school. - Remove electrical cords from floors and keep them out of reach. - Know about and practice fire escape routes at home, work, and school. - Set the water heater temperature at 120°F (48.8°C) or less.

Chemical burn or reaction (First Aid): - Make sure the cause of the burn has been removed. Try not to come in contact with it yourself. If the chemical is dry, brush off any excess. Avoid brushing it into your eyes. Remove any contaminated clothing or jewelry. - Flush the chemicals off the skin surface using cool running water for 15 minutes or more. - Treat the person for shock if he or she appears faint, pale, or if there is shallow, rapid breathing. - Apply cool, wet compresses to relieve pain. - Wrap the burned area with a dry sterile dressing (if possible) or clean cloth. Protect the burned area from pressure and friction. - Minor chemical burns will generally heal without further treatment. However, if there is a second or third degree burn or if there is an overall body reaction, get medical help right away. In severe cases, don&apost leave the person alone and watch carefully for reactions affecting the entire body. Note: If a chemical gets into the eyes, the eyes should be flushed with water right away. Continue to flush the eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Get medical help right away.

Chemical burn or reaction: Chemicals that touch skin can lead to a reaction on the skin, throughout the body, or both. Chemical exposure is not always obvious. You should suspect chemical exposure if an otherwise healthy person becomes ill for no apparent reason, particularly if an empty chemical container is found nearby. Exposure to chemicals at work over a long period of time can cause changing symptoms as the chemical builds up in the person&aposs body. If the person has a chemical in the eyes, see first aid for eye emergencies. If the person has swallowed or inhaled a dangerous chemical, call a local poison control at 1-800-222-1222. Depending on the type of exposure, the symptoms may include: - Abdominal pain - Breathing difficulty - Bright red or bluish skin and lips - Convulsions (seizures) - Dizziness - Eye pain, burning or watering - Headache - Hives, itching, swelling, or weakness resulting from an allergic reaction - Irritability - Nausea and/or vomiting - Pain where the skin has come in contact with the toxic substance - Rash, blisters, burns on the skin - Unconsciousness or other states of altered level of consciousness - Make sure the cause of the burn has been removed. Try not to come in contact with it yourself. If the chemical is dry, brush off any excess. Avoid brushing it into your eyes. Remove any contaminated clothing or jewelry. - Flush the chemicals off the skin surface using cool running water for 15 minutes or more. - Treat the person for shock if he or she appears faint, pale, or if there is shallow, rapid breathing. - Apply cool, wet compresses to relieve pain. - Wrap the burned area with a dry sterile dressing (if possible) or clean cloth. Protect the burned area from pressure and friction. - Minor chemical burns will generally heal without further treatment. However, if there is a second or third degree burn or if there is an overall body reaction, get medical help right away. In severe cases, don&apost leave the person alone and watch carefully for reactions affecting the entire body. Note: If a chemical gets into the eyes, the eyes should be flushed with water right away. Continue to flush the eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Get medical help right away. - DO NOT apply any household remedy such as ointment or salve to a chemical burn. - DO NOT become contaminated by the chemical as you give first aid. - DO NOT disturb a blister or remove dead skin from a chemical burn. - DO NOT try to neutralize any chemical without consulting the Poison Control Center or a doctor. Call for medical help right away if the person is having difficulty breathing, is having seizures, or is unconscious. - All chemicals should be stored out of the reach of young children -- preferably in a locked cabinet. - Avoid mixing different products that contain toxic chemicals such as ammonia and bleach. The mixture can give off hazardous fumes. - Avoid prolonged (even low-level) exposure to chemicals. - Avoid using potentially toxic substances in the kitchen or around food. - Buy potentially poisonous substance in safety containers, and buy only as much as needed. - Many household products are made of toxic chemicals. It is important to read and follow label instructions, including any precautions. - Never store household products in food or drink containers. Leave them in their original containers with the labels intact. - Safely store chemicals immediately after use. - Use paints, petroleum products, ammonia, bleach, and other products that give off fumes only in a well-ventilated area.

This year I have gotten strep throat twice and sore throats with ear aches. Antibiotics have taken 4 different kinds this year alone. Raspy voice, very painful when swallowing	Throat cancer: Throat cancer refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) or tonsils. Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat. Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk. Throat cancer can also affect the piece of cartilage (epiglottis) that acts as a lid for your windpipe. Tonsil cancer, another form of throat cancer, affects the tonsils, which are located on the back of the throat. Throat cancer care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of throat cancer may include: - A cough - Changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly - Difficulty swallowing - Ear pain - A lump or sore that doesn&apost heal - A sore throat - Weight loss When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any new signs and symptoms that are persistent. Most throat cancer symptoms aren&apost specific to cancer, so your doctor will likely investigate other more common causes first. Throat cancer occurs when cells in your throat develop genetic mutations. These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and continue living after healthy cells would normally die. The accumulating cells can form a tumor in your throat. It&aposs not clear what causes the mutation that causes throat cancer. But doctors have identified factors that may increase your risk. Types of throat cancer Throat cancer is a general term that applies to cancer that develops in the throat (pharyngeal cancer) or in the voice box (laryngeal cancer). The throat and the voice box are closely connected, with the voice box located just below the throat. Though most throat cancers involve the same types of cells, specific terms are used to differentiate the part of the throat where cancer originated. - Nasopharyngeal cancer begins in the nasopharynx - the part of your throat just behind your nose. - Oropharyngeal cancer begins in the oropharynx - the part of your throat right behind your mouth that includes your tonsils. - Hypopharyngeal cancer (laryngopharyngeal cancer) begins in the hypopharynx (laryngopharynx) - the lower part of your throat, just above your esophagus and windpipe. - Glottic cancer begins in the vocal cords. - Supraglottic cancer begins in the upper portion of the larynx and includes cancer that affects the epiglottis, which is a piece of cartilage that blocks food from going into your windpipe. - Subglottic cancer begins in the lower portion of your voice box, below your vocal cords. Factors that can increase your risk of throat cancer include: - Tobacco use, including smoking and chewing tobacco - Excessive alcohol use - A sexually transmitted virus called human papillomavirus (HPV) - A diet lacking in fruits and vegetables - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) In order to diagnose throat cancer, your doctor may recommend: - Using a scope to get a closer look at your throat. Your doctor may use a special lighted scope (endoscope) to get a close look at your throat during a procedure called endoscopy. A tiny camera at the end of the endoscope transmits images to a video screen that your doctor watches for signs of abnormalities in your throat. Another type of scope (laryngoscope) can be inserted in your voice box. It uses a magnifying lens to help your doctor examine your vocal cords. This procedure is called laryngoscopy. - Removing a tissue sample for testing. If abnormalities are found during an endoscopy or laryngoscopy, your doctor can pass surgical instruments through the scope to collect a tissue sample (biopsy). The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. Your doctor may also order a sample of a swollen lymph node using a technique called fine-needle aspiration. - Imaging tests. Imaging tests, including X-ray, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), may help your doctor determine the extent of your cancer beyond the surface of your throat or voice box. Staging Once throat cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine the extent (stage) the cancer. Knowing the stage helps determine your treatment options. The stage of throat cancer is characterized with the Roman numerals I through IV. Each subtype of throat cancer has its own criteria for each stage. In general, stage I throat cancer indicates a smaller tumor confined to one area of the throat. Later stages indicate more advanced cancer, with stage IV being the most advanced. Your treatment options are based on many factors, such as the location and stage of your throat cancer, the type of cells involved, your overall health, and your personal preferences. Discuss the benefits and risks of each of your options with your doctor. Together you can determine what treatments will be most appropriate for you.( Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams from sources such as X-rays and protons to deliver radiation to the cancer cells, causing them to die. Radiation therapy can come from a large machine outside your body (external beam radiation), or radiation therapy can come from small radioactive seeds and wires that can be placed inside your body, near your cancer (brachytherapy). For early-stage throat cancers, radiation therapy may be the only treatment necessary. For more-advanced throat cancers, radiation therapy may be combined with chemotherapy or surgery. In very advanced throat cancers, radiation therapy may be used to reduce signs and symptoms and make you more comfortable. Surgery The types of surgical procedures you may consider to treat your throat cancer depend on the location and stage of your cancer. Options may include: - Surgery for early-stage throat cancer. Throat cancer that is confined to the surface of the throat or the vocal cords may be treated surgically using endoscopy. Your doctor may insert a hollow endoscope into your throat or voice box and then pass special surgical tools or a laser through the scope. Using these tools, your doctor can scrape off, cut out or, in the case of the laser, vaporize very superficial cancers. - Surgery to remove all or part of the voice box (laryngectomy). For smaller tumors, your doctor may remove the part of your voice box that is affected by cancer, leaving as much of the voice box as possible. Your doctor may be able to preserve your ability to speak and breathe normally. For larger, more-extensive tumors, it may be necessary to remove your entire voice box. Your windpipe is then attached to a hole (stoma) in your throat to allow you to breathe (tracheotomy). If your entire larynx is removed, you have several options for restoring your speech. You can work with a speech pathologist to learn to speak without your voice box. - Surgery to remove part of the throat (pharyngectomy). Smaller throat cancers may require removing only small parts of your throat during surgery. Parts that are removed may be reconstructed in order to allow you to swallow food normally. - Surgery to remove cancerous lymph nodes (neck dissection). If throat cancer has spread deep within your neck, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove some or all of the lymph nodes to see if they contain cancer cells. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection. Other possible complications, such as difficulty speaking or swallowing, will depend on the specific procedure you undergo. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often used along with radiation therapy in treating throat cancers. Certain chemotherapy drugs make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. But combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy increases the side effects of both treatments. Discuss with your doctor the side effects you&aposre likely to experience and whether combined treatments will offer benefits that outweigh those effects. Targeted drug therapy Targeted drugs treat throat cancer by taking advantage of specific defects in cancer cells that fuel the cells&apos growth. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is one targeted therapy approved for treating throat cancer in certain situations. Cetuximab stops the action of a protein that&aposs found in many types of healthy cells, but is more prevalent in certain types of throat cancer cells. Other targeted drugs are being studied in clinical trials. Targeted drugs can be used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Rehabilitation after treatment Treatment for throat cancer often causes complications that may require working with specialists to regain the ability to swallow, eat solid foods and talk. During and after throat cancer treatment, your doctor may have you seek help for: - Eating difficulties - Swallowing difficulties - Stiffness and pain in your neck - Speech problems Your doctor can discuss the potential side effects and complications of your treatments with you. Throat cancers are closely linked to smoking. Not everyone with throat cancer smokes. But if you do smoke, now is the time to stop because: - Smoking makes treatment less effective. - Smoking makes it harder for your body to heal after surgery. - Smoking increases your risk of getting another cancer in the future. Stopping smoking can be very difficult. And it&aposs that much harder when you&aposre trying to cope with a stressful situation, such as a cancer diagnosis. Your doctor can discuss all of your options, including medications, nicotine replacement products and counseling. Alcohol, particularly when combined with smoking or chewing tobacco, greatly increases the risk of throat cancer. If you drink alcohol, stop now. This may help reduce your risk of a second cancer. Stopping drinking may also help you better tolerate your throat cancer treatments. No alternative treatments have proved helpful in treating throat cancer. However, some complementary and alternative treatments may help you cope with your diagnosis and with the side effects of throat cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor about your options. Alternative treatments you may find helpful include: - Acupuncture - Massage therapy - Meditation - Relaxation techniques

This year I have gotten strep throat twice and sore throats with ear aches. Antibiotics have taken 4 different kinds this year alone. Raspy voice, very painful when swallowing	Throat or larynx cancer: Throat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), or other areas of the throat. People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer. Most throat cancers develop in adults older than 50. Men are more likely than women to develop throat cancer. Watch this video about: Cancer of the throat or larynx Symptoms of throat cancer include any of the following: - Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds - Cough - Coughing up blood - Difficulty swallowing - Hoarseness that does not get better in 3 to 4 weeks - Neck or ear pain - Sore throat that does not get better in 2 to 3 weeks, even with antibiotics - Swelling or lumps in the neck - Weight loss not due to dieting The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show a lump on the outside of the neck. The provider may look in your throat or nose using a flexible tube with a small camera at the end. Other tests that may be ordered include: - Biopsy of suspected tumor - Chest x-ray - CT scan of chest - CT scan of head and neck - MRI of the head or neck - PET scan The goal of treatment is to completely remove the cancer and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body. When the tumor is small, either surgery or radiation therapy alone can be used to remove the tumor. When the tumor is larger or has spread to lymph nodes in the neck, a combination of radiation and chemotherapy is often used to save the voice box (vocal cords). If this is not possible, the voice box is removed. This surgery is called laryngectomy. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Throat cancers may be cured when detected early. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, about half of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable. Treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life. After treatment, therapy is needed to help with speech and swallowing. If the person is not able to swallow, a feeding tube will be needed. Complications of this type of cancer may include: - Airway obstruction - Difficulty swallowing - Disfigurement of the neck or face - Hardening of the skin of the neck - Loss of voice and speaking ability - Spread of the cancer to other body areas (metastasis) Call your provider if: - You have symptoms of throat cancer, especially hoarseness or a change in voice with no obvious cause that lasts longer than 3 weeks - You find a lump in your neck that does not go away in 3 weeks Do not smoke or use other tobacco.

1.8	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. How can I get Information on Cronic Lymphocytice Leukemia sent to me thru MedlinkPlus or which way you will send them.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow - the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. The term "chronic" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that it typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. The term "lymphocytic" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease - a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia most commonly affects older adults. There are treatments to help control the disease. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia care at Mayo Clinic Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no early symptoms. Those who do develop signs and symptoms may experience: - Enlarged, but painless, lymph nodes - Fatigue - Fever - Pain in the upper left portion of the abdomen, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen - Night sweats - Weight loss - Frequent infections When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you. Doctors aren&apost certain what starts the process that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. What&aposs known is that something happens to cause a genetic mutation in the DNA of blood-producing cells. This mutation causes the blood cells to produce abnormal, ineffective lymphocytes. Beyond being ineffective, these abnormal lymphocytes continue to live and multiply, when normal lymphocytes would die. The abnormal lymphocytes accumulate in the blood and certain organs, where they cause complications. They may crowd healthy cells out of the bone marrow and interfere with normal blood cell production. Doctors and researchers are working to understand the exact mechanism that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Factors that may increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include: - Your age. This disease occurs most often in older adults. On average, people diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are in their 70s. - Your race. Whites are more likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia than are people of other races. - Family history of blood and bone marrow cancers. A family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other blood and bone marrow cancers may increase your risk. - Exposure to chemicals. Certain herbicides and insecticides, including Agent Orange used during the Vietnam War, have been linked to an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Blood tests Tests and procedures used to diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia include blood tests designed to: - Count the number of cells in a blood sample. A complete blood count may be used to count the number of lymphocytes in a blood sample. A high number of B cells, one type of lymphocyte, may indicate chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Determine the type of lymphocytes involved. A test called flow cytometry or immunophenotyping helps determine whether an increased number of lymphocytes is due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a different blood disorder or your body&aposs reaction to another process, such as infection. If chronic lymphocytic leukemia is present, flow cytometry may also help analyze the leukemia cells for characteristics that help predict how aggressive the cells are. - Analyze lymphocytes for genetic abnormalities. A test called fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examines the chromosomes inside the abnormal lymphocytes to look for abnormalities. Doctors sometimes use this information to determine your prognosis and help choose a treatment. Other tests In some cases, your doctor may order additional tests and procedures to aid in diagnosis, such as: - Tests of your leukemia cells that look for characteristics that could affect your prognosis - Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration - Imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) Staging Once a diagnosis is confirmed, your doctor determines the extent (stage) of your chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Your doctor will use information about your cancer to assign a stage - early, intermediate or advanced - that indicates the progression of your chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In general, people with early-stage disease don&apost require immediate treatment. Those with intermediate-stage disease and advanced-stage disease may be given the option to begin treatment right away. Your treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia depend on several factors, such as the stage of your cancer, whether you&aposre experiencing signs and symptoms, your overall health, and your preferences. Treatment may not be necessary in early stages People with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia typically don&apost receive treatment. Studies have shown that early treatment doesn&apost extend lives for people with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Rather than put you through the potential side effects and complications of treatment before you need it, doctors carefully monitor your condition and reserve treatment for when your leukemia progresses. Doctors call this watchful waiting. Your doctor will plan a checkup schedule for you. You may meet with your doctor and have your blood tested every few months to monitor your condition. Treatment for people with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia is offered only through clinical trials. Studies that evaluate whether early treatment may be helpful might be an option for people with early-stage disease that has a high risk of progression. Talk to your doctor about your options. Treatments for intermediate and advanced stages Your doctor uses the stage of your chronic lymphocytic leukemia, results from various tests -including laboratory analysis of your cancer cells - and your overall health to make recommendations about your treatment. If your doctor determines your chronic lymphocytic leukemia is progressing or is in the intermediate or advanced stages, your treatment options may include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that kills quickly growing cells, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy treatments can be administered through a vein or taken in pill form. Depending on your situation, your doctor may use a single chemotherapy drug or you may receive a combination of drugs. - Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drugs are designed to take advantage of the specific vulnerabilities of your cancer cells. Your cancer cells are tested to determine which targeted drugs may be helpful. - Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses your body&aposs immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy treatments may make it easier for your immune system to identify cancer cells or train your immune system cells to fight cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, uses strong chemotherapy drugs to kill the stem cells in your bone marrow that are creating diseased lymphocytes. Then healthy adult blood stem cells from a donor are infused into your blood, where they travel to your bone marrow and begin making healthy blood cells. As new and more-effective drug combinations have been developed, bone marrow transplant has become less common in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Still in certain cases, this may be a treatment option. Treatments may be used alone or in combination with each other. Supportive care Your doctor will meet with you regularly to monitor any complications you may experience. Supportive care measures may help prevent or relieve any signs or symptoms. Supportive care may include: - Cancer screening. Your doctor will evaluate your risk of other types of cancer and may recommend screening to look for signs of other cancers. For instance, your doctor may recommend a skin examination every year or two to look for signs of skin cancer. - Vaccinations to prevent infections. Your doctor may recommend certain vaccinations to reduce your risk of infections, such as pneumonia and influenza. - Monitoring for other health problems. Your doctor may recommend regular checkups to monitor your health during and after treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. No alternative treatments have been proved to cure chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Alternative treatments for coping with fatigue Some alternative medicine therapies may help you cope with fatigue, which is commonly experienced by people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Your doctor can treat fatigue by controlling the underlying causes, but often medications alone aren&apost enough. You may find relief through alternative therapies, such as: - Exercise - Massage - Meditation - Relaxation techniques - Yoga Talk to your doctor about your options. Together you can devise a plan to help you cope with fatigue. Green tea extracts for people with early-stage leukemia A green tea extract has shown some promise in initial clinical trials for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Laboratory research determined that a compound in green tea extract, called EGCG, can kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. A study of people with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia found that EGCG in pill form reduced some signs of the disease. But green tea trials haven&apost been conclusive, and this subject requires more study before doctors can agree on the merits of this treatment.
1.9	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. How can I get Information on Cronic Lymphocytice Leukemia sent to me thru MedlinkPlus or which way you will send them.	What is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia?: Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there are too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. CLL is the second most common type of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age, and is rare in children. Usually CLL does not cause any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin - Fatigue - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs - Fever and infection - Weight loss Tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes diagnose CLL. Your doctor may choose to just monitor you until symptoms appear or change. Treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery to remove the spleen, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Diagnosis): Blood tests Tests and procedures used to diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia include blood tests designed to: - Count the number of cells in a blood sample. A complete blood count may be used to count the number of lymphocytes in a blood sample. A high number of B cells, one type of lymphocyte, may indicate chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Determine the type of lymphocytes involved. A test called flow cytometry or immunophenotyping helps determine whether an increased number of lymphocytes is due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a different blood disorder or your body&aposs reaction to another process, such as infection. If chronic lymphocytic leukemia is present, flow cytometry may also help analyze the leukemia cells for characteristics that help predict how aggressive the cells are. - Analyze lymphocytes for genetic abnormalities. A test called fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examines the chromosomes inside the abnormal lymphocytes to look for abnormalities. Doctors sometimes use this information to determine your prognosis and help choose a treatment. Other tests In some cases, your doctor may order additional tests and procedures to aid in diagnosis, such as: - Tests of your leukemia cells that look for characteristics that could affect your prognosis - Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration - Imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) Staging Once a diagnosis is confirmed, your doctor determines the extent (stage) of your chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Your doctor will use information about your cancer to assign a stage - early, intermediate or advanced - that indicates the progression of your chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In general, people with early-stage disease don&apost require immediate treatment. Those with intermediate-stage disease and advanced-stage disease may be given the option to begin treatment right away.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Causes): Doctors aren&apost certain what starts the process that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. What&aposs known is that something happens to cause a genetic mutation in the DNA of blood-producing cells. This mutation causes the blood cells to produce abnormal, ineffective lymphocytes. Beyond being ineffective, these abnormal lymphocytes continue to live and multiply, when normal lymphocytes would die. The abnormal lymphocytes accumulate in the blood and certain organs, where they cause complications. They may crowd healthy cells out of the bone marrow and interfere with normal blood cell production. Doctors and researchers are working to understand the exact mechanism that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
1.7	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. How can I get Information on Cronic Lymphocytice Leukemia sent to me thru MedlinkPlus or which way you will send them.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer of the lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell ). It begins in the stem cells of the bone marrow and then spreads to the blood. Over time, CLL may also spread to the lymph nodes and other organs , including the liver, spleen and lungs. [1] Early signs and symptoms of CLL may include swollen lymph nodes,  fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, fever, night sweats and/or frequent infections. [2] [1] The underlying cause of CLL is unknown. It usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, but familial cases have been reported. [3] [4] Treatment options depend on many factors, including the stage of the condition, blood cell counts, and whether the CLL has recurred (come back). [3] [1] Treatment may not be necessary until a person develops symptoms or there is other evidence of rapid cancer progression. [3] [2] The chance of recovery and life expectancy vary from person to person. While most people with CLL live at least 5 to 10 years, some do not survive more than 2 to 3 years after the diagnosis. [3] Many people with CLL have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. In these cases, the condition is often found incidentally (by chance) during a routine blood test. Symptoms usually develop slowly, although CLL can progress quickly in rare cases. [1] The signs and symptoms of CLL vary, but may include: [2] [1] [3] Enlarged lymph nodes Enlarged liver and/or spleen Night sweats Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Weight loss Frequent infections Abnormal bruising The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant somatic cell mutation - Cellular immunodeficiency - Chronic lymphatic leukemia - Somatic mutation - The underlying cause of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is not known. [3] [4] It is believed that CLL occurs following a pre-cancerous condition known as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). However, MBL is present in 5 to 15 percent of people over the age of 60. It is not known why a very small percentage of people with MBL develop CLL. [5] While familial cases have been reported, no genes directly responsible for CLL have been identified. [4] Scientists are studying specific regions of chromosomes to see if some people may inherit a genetic susceptibility to developing CLL. [4] Some factors appear to increase a person&aposs risk for CLL. It is important to note that having one or more risk factors does not mean that a person will definitely develop CLL. Most people with risk factors will not develop CLL. Risk factors may include: [1] [3] [2] Being over age 45 Being male Being white Having other family members with CLL or other cancers of the lymph system Having family members who are Russian Jews or Eastern European Jews Being exposed to Agent Orange (an herbicide used to kill unwanted plants) during the Vietnam War Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is generally considered an acquired condition and usually occurs in people with no family history of CLL. However, familial cases have been reported. [6] CLL and other cancers affecting the lymph system and blood occur more frequently in first-degree relatives of people with CLL than in the general population. There is currently no proof that CLL itself is inherited , but certain genes (or combinations of genes) may predispose a person to familial cancer, including CLL. A number different chromosomal regions are being studied to identify possible susceptibility genes for familial CLL. [4] Having a genetic predisposition or susceptibility does not mean that a person will definitely develop CLL or another type of cancer; it means a person has an increased risk to develop cancer. While cancer cells in CLL are found to have genetic changes or mutations , these changes are acquired (not inherited) and are limited to the cancer cells. [6] They are called somatic mutations and are not passed on from parent to child. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is often first suspected incidentally (by chance) during a routine blood test. [1] In some cases, signs and symptoms suggest that a person might have CLL, but tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. [7] The tests that are needed may differ from person to person. Blood tests that may be used to confirm a diagnosis of CLL include: [7] Complete blood count - people with CLL have too many lymphocytes (called lymphocytosis). Peripheral blood smear - when blood is looked at under the microscope, it might show abnormal-looking lymphocytes. Flow cytometry - looks for characteristics of cells that show they are CLL cells, and may be used to determine the extent of the cancer (it&aposs stage). While blood tests are often enough to diagnose CLL, other types of tests may be used for further confirmation, to see how advanced the cancer is, and/or predict a person&aposs prognosis (outlook). These may include:[7][3] Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy - samples of bone marrow may be taken from the back of the hip bone or other bones. The samples are looked at under the microscope and may undergo various tests. Lymph node biopsy - may be recommended if a lymph node has grown and there is concern the leukemia has developed into a more aggressive cancer. Imaging tests ( ultrasound , CT scan or MRI ) - these may be done if there is concern the cancer has spread to another organ . Gene tests - cells from blood or bone marrow samples are grown in the lab so their chromosomes can be examined. Some cases of CLL have chromosome changes that can be seen under the microscope. The best treatment for each person with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) depends on many factors, including whether a person has symptoms, the stage of the condition, results of various tests, and whether the CLL has recurred (come back). [1] For example, people with early stage CLL who have no symptoms may simply be closely monitored by their doctor without any treatment (watchful waiting). [2] When a person develops symptoms, or there are signs the cancer has progressed, treatment options may include: [2] [3] [1] Chemotherapy   Radiation therapy Targeted therapy -  drugs or other substances used to find and kill cancer cells without hurting normal cells. Examples include monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and BCL2 inhibitor therapy. Blood or platelet transfusions if blood counts are low Bone marrowstem cell transplantation More information about the treatment of CLL can be viewed on the National Cancer Institute&aposs page about CLL treatment.

These include: [1] [7] The presence and type of genetic changes in CLL cells - for example, the loss of part of chromosome 13 is often associated with less aggressive disease and a better outlook, while changes in chromosomes 11 or 17 are linked to a poorer outlook. Whether lymphocytes are spread throughout the bone marrow - small groups of cells are associated with a better outlook than if cells are scattered throughout the marrow. The stage of the disease. Whether the CLL is improving with treatment or has recurred (come back). Whether the CLL develops into lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia. The person&aposs general health. Most people diagnosed with CLL live 5 to 10 years. Often there are few health issues for several years, followed by 1 to 2 years of progressive disease. During this time, quality of life is diminished due to both the condition and complications of treatment. [3] About half of people diagnosed in the early stages live more than 12 years. [2] Lastly, some people do not survive more than 2 to 3 years after the diagnosis due to complications from CLL. [3]

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Summary): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes. These cells are found in the bone marrow and other parts of the body. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. CLL causes a slow increase in a certain type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes, or B cells. Cancer cells spread through the blood and bone marrow. CLL can also affect the lymph nodes or other organs such as the liver and spleen. CLL eventually can cause the bone marrow to lose its function.

Thank you	Retinitis pigmentosa (Treatment): Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease appear to be relatively weak. [4] Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish.  While DHA is known to play a structural role in retinal cells , more research is needed to determine whether supplements should be recommended. [2] Current research is focused on the development of new treatments including gene therapy , retinal transplantation, and the use of a retinal prosthesis. Stem cell transplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missing enzymes and chemicals needed for sight. Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causing mutation is known and would aim to restore production of the missing or abnormal protein . Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly to the inner retina and brain, avoiding the diseased part of the outer retina. Though challenges remain, preliminary research into these technologies has been promising.

They may also develop swelling of the retina (macular edema). Cataracts can be removed if they contribute to vision loss. Many other conditions are similar to retinitis pigmentosa, including: - Friedreich&aposs ataxia - Laurence-Moon syndrome (also called Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome) - Mucopolysaccharidosis - Myotonic dystrophy - Usher syndrome (a combination of retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss)

Thank you	Retinitis pigmentosa: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss. The first sign of RP usually is night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), and eventually loss of central vision. RP may be caused by  mutations in any of at least 50 genes . Inheritance can be autosomal dominant ,  autosomal recessive , or  X-linked . [1] Treatment options to slow the progression of vision loss include light avoidance, use of low-vision aids, and vitamin A supplementation. Researchers are working to develop new treatment options for the future such as gene therapy , stem cell transplantation and prosthetic implants.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant ,  autosomal recessive , or  X-linked manner. The mode of inheritance in a particular family is determined by evaluating the family history and, in some instances, by molecular genetic testing . There are many potential complications in interpreting the family history, so in some cases, identifying the responsible gene with genetic testing is needed. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that having a change ( mutation ) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% chance to inherit that mutation. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a  carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected. When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% chance to be affected 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not a carrier X-linked inheritance means that the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome . Males have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome ), while females have two X chromosomes. Males who have a mutation on their X chromosome will be affected, while female carriers of the mutation may be affected or unaffected, because they have another X chromosome with a normal copy of the gene. All the daughters of an affected male will inherit the mutation; none of his sons will inherit the mutation. The sons of a female with a mutation have a 50% chance to inherit the mutation and be affected; the daughters have a 50% chance to inherit the mutation (and be affected or unaffected). Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.

Thank you	Facts About Retinitis Pigmentosa (Are there treatments for RP?): Living with vision loss A number of services and devices are available to help people with vision loss carry out daily activities and maintain their independence. In addition to an eye care professional, itís important to have help from a team of experts, which may include occupational therapists, orientation and mobility specialists, certified low vision therapists, and others. NEI has more information on living with low vision. Children with RP may benefit from low vision aids that maximize existing vision. For example, there are special lenses that magnify central vision to expand visual field and eliminate glare. Computer programs that read text are readily available. Closed circuit televisions with a camera can adjust text to suit oneís vision. Portable lighting devices can adjust a dark or dim environment. Mobility training can teach people to use a cane or a guide dog, and eye scanning techniques can help people to optimize remaining vision. Once a child is diagnosed, he or she will be referred to a low vision specialist for a comprehensive evaluation. Parents may also want to meet with the childís school administrators and teachers to make sure that necessary accommodations are put in place. For parents of children with RP, one challenge is to determine when a child might need to learn to use a cane or a guide dog. Having regular eye examinations to measure the progress of the disorder will help parents make informed decisions regarding low vision services and rehabilitation. Targeted therapies for RP An NEI-sponsored clinical trial found that a daily dose of 15,000 international units of vitamin A palmitate modestly slowed the progression of the disorder in adults. Because there are so many forms of RP, it is difficult to predict how any one patient will respond to this treatment. Talk to an eye care professional to determine if taking vitamin A is right for you or your child. An artificial vision device called the Argus II has also shown promise for restoring some vision to people with late-stage RP. The Argus II, developed by Second Sight with NEI support, is a prosthetic device that functions in place of lost photoreceptor cells. It consists of a light-sensitive electrode that is surgically implanted on the retina. A pair of glasses with a camera wirelessly transmits signals to the electrode that are then relayed to the brain. Although it does not restore normal vision, in clinical studies, the Argus II enabled people with RP to read large letters and navigate environments without the use of a cane or guide dog. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a humanitarian device exemption for use of the Argus II to treat late-stage RP. This means the device has not proven effective, but the FDA has determined that its probable benefits outweigh its risks to health. The Argus II is eligible for Medicare payment.

Thank you	RPGR gene (Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes): More than 300 mutations in the RPGR gene have been found to cause the X-linked form of retinitis pigmentosa. This condition primarily affects males, causing night blindness in early childhood followed by progressive daytime vision loss. RPGR gene mutations account for about 70 percent of all cases of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Most of the mutations responsible for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa occur in the ORF15 exon of the RPGR protein. These mutations usually result in an abnormally short, malfunctioning protein. Changes in the structure of the RPGR protein likely disrupt the normal function of cilia in photoreceptor cells. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the gradual loss of photoreceptors and resulting vision problems that are characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa.

Thank you	Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body&aposs immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider&aposs supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

You can buy psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) without a prescription. Ask your provider about these. Always talk to your provider before using any laxative medicines. You may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain. Drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your provider about medicines you can use. You may need a prescription for stronger pain medicines. There are many types of drugs that can help prevent or treat attacks of your Crohn disease.

Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	Generalized anxiety disorder - self-care (Therapy): Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist and in a safe place. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people&aposs behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.

-1.45454545455	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	Therapeutic drug levels (Therapeutic drug levels, Therapeutic drug monitoring): Therapeutic drug levels are lab tests to look for the presence and the amount of a drug in the blood. A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. You will need to prepare for some drug level tests. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to change the times you take any of your medicines. DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. With most medicines, you need a certain level of the drug in your blood to get the proper effect. Some medicines are harmful if the level rises too high and do not work if the levels are too low. Monitoring the amount of the drug found in your blood allows your provider to make sure the drug levels are in the proper range. Drug level testing is important in people taking drugs such as: Flecainide, procainamide or digoxin, which are used to treat abnormal beating of the heart Phenytoin or valproic acid, which are used to treat seizures Gentamicin or amikacin, which are antibiotics used to treat infections Testing may also be done to determine how well your body breaks down the drug or how it interacts with other drugs you need. Following are some of the drugs that are commonly checked and the normal target levels: Acetaminophen: varies with use Amikacin: 15 to 25 mcg/mL (25.62 to 42.70 micromol/L) Aminophylline: 10 to 20 mcg/mL (55.50 to 111.00 micromol/L) Amitriptyline: 120 to 150 ng/mL (432.60 to 540.75 nmol/L) Carbamazepine: 5 to 12 mcg/mL (21.16 to 50.80 micromol/L) Cyclosporine: 100 to 400 ng/mL (83.20 to 332.80 nmol/L) (12 hours after dose) Desipramine: 150 to 300 ng/mL (563.10 to 1126.20 nmol/L) Digoxin: 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL (1.02 to 2.56 nanomol/L) Disopyramide: 2 to 5 mcg/mL (5.89 to 14.73 micromol/L) Ethosuximide: 40 to 100 mcg/mL (283.36 to 708.40 micromol/L) Flecainide: 0.2 to 1.0 mcg/mL (0.5 to 2.4 micromol/L) Gentamicin: 5 to 10 mcg/mL (10.45 to 20.90 micromol/L) Imipramine: 150 to 300 ng/mL (534.90 to 1069.80 nmol/L) Kanamycin: 20 to 25 mcg/mL (41.60 to 52.00 micromol/L) Lidocaine: 1.5 to 5.0 mcg/mL (6.40 to 21.34 micromol/L) Lithium: 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L (0.8 to 1.2 mmol/L) Methotrexate: varies with use Nortriptyline: 50 to 150 ng/mL (189.85 to 569.55 nmol/L) Phenobarbital: 10 to 30 mcg/mL (43.10 to 129.30 micromol/L) Phenytoin: 10 to 20 mcg/mL (39.68 to 79.36 micromol/L) Primidone: 5 to 12 mcg/mL (22.91 to 54.98 micromol/L) Procainamide: 4 to 10 mcg/mL (17.00 to 42.50 micomol/L) Quinidine: 2 to 5 mcg/mL (6.16 to 15.41 micromol/L) Salicylate: varies with use Sirolimus: 4 to 20 ng/mL (4 to 22 nmol/L) (12 hours after dose; varies with use) Tacrolimus: 5 to 15 ng/mL (4 to 25 nmol/L) (12 hours after dose) Theophylline: 10 to 20 mcg/mL (55.50 to 111.00 micromol/L) Tobramycin: 5 to 10 mcg/mL (10.69 to 21.39 micromol/L) Valproic acid: 50 to 100 mcg/mL (346.70 to 693.40 micromol/L) Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Values outside the target range may be due to minor changes or be a sign that you need to adjust your dosages. Your provider may tell you to skip a dose if the values measured are too high. Following are toxic levels for some of the drugs that are commonly checked: Acetaminophen: greater than 250 mcg/mL (1653.50 micromol/L) Amikacin: greater than 25 mcg/mL (42.70 micromol/L) Aminophylline: greater than 20 mcg/mL (111.00 micromol/L) Amitriptyline: greater than 500 ng/mL (1802.50 nmol/L) Carbamazepine: greater than 12 mcg/mL (50.80 micromol/L) Cyclosporine: greater than 400 ng/mL (332.80 micromol/L) Desipramine: greater than 500 ng/mL (1877.00 nmol/L) Digoxin: greater than 2.4 ng/mL (3.07 nmol/L) Disopyramide: greater than 5 mcg/mL (14.73 micromol/L) Ethosuximide: greater than 100 mcg/mL (708.40 micromol/L) Flecainide: greater than 1.0 mcg/mL (2.4 micromol/L) Gentamicin: greater than 12 mcg/mL (25.08 micromol/L) Imipramine: greater than 500 ng/mL (1783.00 nmol/L) Kanamycin: greater than 35 mcg/mL (72.80 micromol/L) Lidocaine: greater than 5 mcg/mL (21.34 micromol/L) Lithium: greater than 2.0 mEq/L (2.00 millimol/L) Methotrexate: greater than 10 mcmol/L (10,000 nmol/L) over 24-hours Nortriptyline: greater than 500 ng/mL (1898.50 nmol/L) Phenobarbital: greater than 40 mcg/mL (172.40 micromol/L) Phenytoin: greater than 30 mcg/mL (119.04 micromol/L) Primidone: greater than 15 mcg/mL (68.73 micromol/L) Procainamide: greater than 16 mcg/mL (68.00 micromol/L) Quinidine: greater than 10 mcg/mL (30.82 micromol/L) Salicylate: greater than 300 mcg/mL (2172.00 micromol/L) Theophylline: greater than 20 mcg/mL (111.00 micromol/L) Tobramycin: greater than 12 mcg/mL (25.67 micromol/L) Valproic acid: greater than 100 mcg/mL (693.40 micromol/L) Updated by: Laura J.

1.90909090909	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	IMH » Anxiety Disorders (Treatments and Therapies): Anxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. There are many ways to treat anxiety and people should work with their doctor to choose the treatment that is best for them. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy or "talk therapy" can help people with anxiety disorders. To be effective, psychotherapy must be directed at the person&aposs specific anxieties and tailored to his or her needs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an example of one type of psychotherapy that can help people with anxiety disorders. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to anxiety-producing and fearful objects and situations. CBT can also help people learn and practice social skills, which is vital for treating social anxiety disorder. Cognitive therapy and exposure therapy are two CBT methods that are often used, together or by themselves, to treat social anxiety disorder. Cognitive therapy focuses on identifying, challenging, and then neutralizing unhelpful or distorted thoughts underlying anxiety disorders. Exposure therapy focuses on confronting the fears underlying an anxiety disorder to help people engage in activities they have been avoiding. Exposure therapy is sometimes used along with relaxation exercises and/or imagery. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar difficulties. Often "homework" is assigned for participants to complete between sessions. Medication Medication does not cure anxiety disorders but can help relieve symptoms. Medication for anxiety is prescribed by doctors, such as a psychiatrist or primary care provider. Some states also allow psychologists who have received specialized training to prescribe psychiatric medications. The most common classes of medications used to combat anxiety disorders are anti-anxiety drugs (such as benzodiazepines), antidepressants, and beta-blockers. Anti-Anxiety Medications Anti-anxiety medications can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, or extreme fear and worry. The most common anti-anxiety medications are called benzodiazepines. Although benzodiazepines are sometimes used as first-line treatments for generalized anxiety disorder, they have both benefits and drawbacks. Some benefits of benzodiazepines are that they are effective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than antidepressant medications often prescribed for anxiety. Some drawbacks of benzodiazepines are that people can build up a tolerance to them if they are taken over a long period of time and they may need higher and higher doses to get the same effect. Some people may even become dependent on them. To avoid these problems, doctors usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods of time, a practice that is especially helpful for older adults, people who have substance abuse problems, and people who become dependent on medication easily. If people suddenly stop taking benzodiazepines, they may have withdrawal symptoms, or their anxiety may return. Therefore, benzodiazepines should be tapered off slowly. When you and your doctor have decided it is time to stop the medication, the doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. For long-term use, benzodiazepines are often considered a second-line treatment for anxiety (with antidepressants being considered a first-line treatment) as well as an "as-needed" treatment for any distressing flare-ups of symptoms. A different type of anti-anxiety medication is buspirone . Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine medication specifically indicated for the treatment of chronic anxiety, although it does not help everyone. Antidepressants Antidepressants are used to treat depression, but they can also be helpful for treating anxiety disorders. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. You may need to try several different antidepressant medicines before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects. A medication that has helped you or a close family member in the past will often be considered. Antidepressants can take time to work, so it&aposs important to give the medication a chance before reaching a conclusion about its effectiveness. If you begin taking antidepressants, do not stop taking them without the help of a doctor. When you and your doctor have decided it is time to stop the medication, the doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Stopping them abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used as first-line treatments for anxiety. Less-commonly used - but effective - treatments for anxiety disorders are older classes of antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Please Note: In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressant medications, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. Because of this, patients of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. Beta-Blockers Although beta-blockers are most often used to treat high blood pressure, they can also be used to help relieve the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heartbeat, shaking, trembling, and blushing. These medications, when taken for a short period of time, can help people keep physical symptoms under control. They can also be used "as needed" to reduce acute anxiety, including as a preventive intervention for some predictable forms of performance anxieties. Choosing the Right Medication Some types of drugs may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders, so people should work closely with their doctor to identify which medication is best for them. Certain substances such as caffeine, some over-the-counter cold medicines, illicit drugs, and herbal supplements may aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders or interact with prescribed medication. Patients should talk with their doctor, so they can learn which substances are safe and which to avoid. Choosing the right medication, medication dose, and treatment plan should be done under an expert&aposs care and should be based on a person&aposs needs and their medical situation. Your doctor may try several medicines before finding the right one. You and your doctor should discuss: How well medications are working or might work to improve your symptoms Benefits and side effects of each medication Risk for serious side effects based on your medical history The likelihood of the medications requiring lifestyle changes Costs of each medication Other alternative therapies, medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking and how these may affect your treatment; a combination of medication and psychotherapy is the best approach for many people with anxiety disorders How the medication should be stopped (Some drugs can&apost be stopped abruptly and must be tapered off slowly under a doctor&aposs supervision). For more information, please visit Mental Health Medications Health Topic webpage. Please note that any information on this website regarding medications is provided for educational purposes only and may be outdated. Diagnosis and treatment decisions should be made in consultation with your doctor. Information about medications changes frequently. Please visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Support Groups Some people with anxiety disorders might benefit from joining a self-help or support group and sharing their problems and achievements with others. Internet chat rooms might also be useful, but any advice received over the internet should be used with caution, as Internet acquaintances have usually never seen each other and what has helped one person is not necessarily what is best for another. You should always check with your doctor before following any treatment advice found on the internet. Talking with a trusted friend or member of the clergy can also provide support, but it is not necessarily a sufficient alternative to care from a doctor or other health professional. Stress Management Techniques Stress management techniques and meditation can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy. Research suggests that aerobic exercise can help some people manage their anxiety; however, exercise should not take the place of standard care and more research is needed.

Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	Chemotherapy (Chemotherapy, Cancer chemotherapy , Cancer drug therapy , Cytotoxic chemotherapy): The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: Cure the cancer Shrink the cancer Prevent the cancer from spreading Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: Injections or shots into the muscles Injections or shots under the skin Into an artery Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) Pills taken by mouth Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: Central venous catheter Central venous catheter with a port Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: Are more likely to have infections Become tired more easily Bleed too much, even during everyday activities Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth Have a poor appetite or lose weight Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea Lose their hair Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs Eating and drinking safely Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Richard LoCicero, MD, private practice specializing in hematology and medical oncology, Longstreet Cancer Center, Gainesville, GA.

1.81818181818	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	IMH » Depression (Treatment and Therapies): Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is. Depression is usually treated with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies may be options to explore. Quick Tip: No two people are affected the same way by depression and there is no "one-size-fits-all" for treatment. It may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you. Medications Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. You may need to try several different antidepressant medicines before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects. A medication that has helped you or a close family member in the past will often be considered. Antidepressants take time - usually 2 to 4 weeks - to work, and often, symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems improve before mood lifts, so it is important to give medication a chance before reaching a conclusion about its effectiveness. If you begin taking antidepressants, do not stop taking them without the help of a doctor. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. When you and your doctor have decided it is time to stop the medication, usually after a course of 6 to 12 months, the doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Stopping them abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Please Note: In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. This warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also says that patients of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. If you are considering taking an antidepressant and you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about any increased health risks to you or your unborn or nursing child. To find the latest information about antidepressants, talk to your doctor and visit www.fda.gov. You may have heard about an herbal medicine called St. John&aposs wort. Although it is a top-selling botanical product, the FDA has not approved its use as an over-the-counter or prescription medicine for depression, and there are serious concerns about its safety (it should never be combined with a prescription antidepressant) and effectiveness. Do not use St. John&aposs wort before talking to your health care provider. Other natural products sold as dietary supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), remain under study but have not yet been proven safe and effective for routine use. For more information on herbal and other complementary approaches and current research, please visit the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website. Psychotherapies Several types of psychotherapy (also called "talk therapy" or, in a less specific form, counseling) can help people with depression. Examples of evidence-based approaches specific to the treatment of depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem-solving therapy. More information on psychotherapy is available on the NIMH website and in the NIMH publication Depression: What You Need to Know . Brain Stimulation Therapies If medications do not reduce the symptoms of depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an option to explore. Based on the latest research: ECT can provide relief for people with severe depression who have not been able to feel better with other treatments. Electroconvulsive therapy can be an effective treatment for depression. In some severe cases where a rapid response is necessary or medications cannot be used safely, ECT can even be a first-line intervention. Once strictly an inpatient procedure, today ECT is often performed on an outpatient basis. The treatment consists of a series of sessions, typically three times a week, for two to four weeks. ECT may cause some side effects, including confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. Usually these side effects are short-term, but sometimes memory problems can linger, especially for the months around the time of the treatment course. Advances in ECT devices and methods have made modern ECT safe and effective for the vast majority of patients. Talk to your doctor and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of the treatment before giving your informed consent to undergoing ECT. ECT is not painful, and you cannot feel the electrical impulses. Before ECT begins, a patient is put under brief anesthesia and given a muscle relaxant. Within one hour after the treatment session, which takes only a few minutes, the patient is awake and alert. Other more recently introduced types of brain stimulation therapies used to treat medicine-resistant depression include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Other types of brain stimulation treatments are under study. You can learn more about these therapies on the NIMH Brain Stimulation Therapies webpage. If you think you may have depression, start by making an appointment to see your doctor or health care provider. This could be your primary care practitioner or a health provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. Visit the NIMH Find Help for Mental Illnesses if you are unsure of where to start. Beyond Treatment: Things You Can Do Here are other tips that may help you or a loved one during treatment for depression: Try to be active and exercise. Set realistic goals for yourself. Try to spend time with other people and confide in a trusted friend or relative. Try not to isolate yourself, and let others help you. Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately. Postpone important decisions, such as getting married or divorced, or changing jobs until you feel better. Discuss decisions with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation. Continue to educate yourself about depression.

-1.81818181818	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	Radiation therapy (Radiation therapy, Radiotherapy , Cancer - radiation therapy , Radiation therapy - radioactive seeds , Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) , Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) , Radiosurgery-radiation therapy , Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)-radiation therapy , Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)-radiation therapy , Intraoperative radiotherapy , Proton radiotherapy-radiation therapy): Radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death. Radiation therapy is used to fight many types of cancer. Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed. It may also be used in combination with other therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy to: Shrink a tumor as much as possible before surgery Help prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery or chemotherapy Relieve symptoms caused by a tumor, such as pain, pressure, or bleeding Treat cancers that cannot be removed with surgery TYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY Different types of radiation therapy include external, internal, and intraoperative. EXTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY External radiation is the most common form. This method carefully aims high-powered x-rays or particles directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Newer methods provide more effective treatment with less tissue damage. These include: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) Stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) Proton therapy is another kind of radiation used to treat cancer. Rather than using x-rays to destroy cancer cells, proton therapy uses a beam of special particles called protons. Because it causes less damage to healthy tissue, proton therapy is often used for cancers that are very close to critical parts of the body. It is only used for certain types of cancer. INTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY Internal beam radiation is placed inside your body. One method uses radioactive seeds that are placed directly into or near the tumor. This method is called brachytherapy, and is used to treat prostate cancer. It is used less often to treat breast, cervical, lung, and other cancers. Another method involves receiving radiation by drinking it, swallowing a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. Thyroid cancer may be treated this way. INTRAOPERTIVE RADIATION THERAPY (IORT) This type of radiation is usually used during surgery to remove a tumor. Right after the tumor is removed and before the surgeon closes the incision, radiation is delivered to the site where the tumor used to be. IORT is generally used for tumors that have not spread and microscopic tumor cells may remain after the larger tumor is removed. Compared with external radiation, advantages of IORT may include: Only the tumor area is targeted so there is less harm to healthy tissue Only a single dose of radiation is given Delivers a smaller dose of radiation SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation, and how often you have the therapy. External beam radiation may cause skin changes, such as hair loss, red or burning skin, thinning of skin tissue, or even shedding of the outer layer of skin. Other side effects depend on the part of body receiving radiation: Abdomen Brain Breast Chest Mouth and neck Pelvic (between the hips) Prostate Updated by: David Herold, MD, radiation oncologist in West Palm Beach, FL.

-0.363636363636	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	IMH » HIV/AIDS and Mental Health (Treatments and Therapies): Research shows that HIV treatment should be initiated as soon as infection is detected to achieve the best health outcomes. Once diagnosed, HIV infection is treated using a combination of medicines called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adequate adherence to prescribed treatment regimens, such as taking the medications as prescribed by the health care provider, is critical to controlling the virus and to achieving complete viral suppression. Adequate adherence can be difficult but many strategies have been developed to assist individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Starting antiretroviral therapy also can affect your mental health in different ways. Sometimes antiretroviral therapy can relieve your anxiety because knowing that you are taking care of yourself can give you a sense of security. However, coping with the reality of living with a chronic illness can be challenging. Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions experienced by people living with HIV, just as it is in the general population. In addition, some antiretroviral medications may cause symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, and may make some mental health issues worse. For these reasons, it is important to talk to your health care provider about your mental health. A conversation about mental health should be part of your complete medical evaluation before starting antiretroviral medications. Continue to discuss your mental health with your healthcare team throughout treatment. Be open and honest with your provider about any changes in the way you are thinking, or how you are feeling about yourself and life in general. Also discuss any alcohol or substance use with your provider so that he or she can help connect you to treatment if necessary. For more information, see the AIDS.gov page on Substance Use. In addition, tell your healthcare provider about any over-the-counter or prescribed medications you may be taking, including any psychiatric medications, because some of these drugs may interact with antiretroviral medications.
-1.90909090909	ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression	Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body&aposs immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider&aposs supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

1.9	ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information. Please i really need your reply and your help :( My wife has Allergy from all milk products and whenever she drinks or eats any thing contains small amount of any milk products she goes to the hospital. I have faith that there is a cure for that but i really donno what to say to her. She thinks that she will never be cured. So please can you tell me is there is any cure for milk products allergy, any cure? or any cure in the very near future? I will be very very very grateful if you replied, Thanks alot. :)	Food allergy (Treatment): The only way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the foods that cause signs and symptoms. However, despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with a food that causes a reaction. For a minor allergic reaction, over-the-counter or prescribed antihistamines may help reduce symptoms. These drugs can be taken after exposure to an allergy-causing food to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines can&apost treat a severe allergic reaction. For a severe allergic reaction, you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine and a trip to the emergency room. Many people with allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen). This device is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medication when pressed against your thigh. If your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector: - Be sure you know how to use the autoinjector. Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to administer the drug - if they&aposre with you in an anaphylactic emergency, they could save your life. - Carry it with you at all times. It may be a good idea to keep an extra autoinjector in your car or in your desk at work. - Always be sure to replace epinephrine before its expiration date or it may not work properly. Experimental treatments While there&aposs ongoing research to find better treatments to reduce food allergy symptoms and prevent allergy attacks, there isn&apost any proven treatment that can prevent or completely relieve symptoms. Treatments being studied are: - Anti-IgE therapy. The medication omalizumab (Xolair) interferes with the body&aposs ability to use IgE. The drug is currently being studied for treatment of allergic asthma and food allergies. This treatment is still considered experimental, and more research needs to be done on the drug&aposs long-term safety. It has been associated with a potential increased risk of anaphylaxis. - Oral immunotherapy. Researchers have been studying the use of oral immunotherapy as a treatment for food allergy. Small doses of the food you&aposre allergic to are swallowed or placed under your tongue (sublingual). The dose of the allergy-provoking food is gradually increased. Initial results look promising, even in people with peanut, egg and milk allergies. But more research needs to be done to ensure that this treatment is safe. - Early exposure. In the past, it&aposs been generally recommended that children avoid allergenic foods to reduce the likelihood of developing allergies. But in a recent study, high-risk infants - such as those with atopic dermatitis or egg allergy or both - were selected to either ingest or avoid peanut products from 4 to 11 months of age until 5 years of age. Researchers found that high-risk children who regularly consumed peanut protein, such as peanut butter or peanut-flavored snacks, were 70 to 86 percent less likely to develop a peanut allergy. These findings may impact food allergy guidelines in the future.

This prescription is not refillable. If you continue to have pain or a cough after you finish taking your medication, call your doctor. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

So please can you tell me is there is any cure for milk products allergy, any cure? or any cure in the very near future? I will be very very very grateful if you replied, Thanks alot. :)	Food allergy (Treatment): If you suspect that you or your child has a food allergy, see an allergy specialist doctor (allergist). Treatment may involve any of the following: - Avoiding the food (this is the most effective treatment). - Desensitization, during which you eat a small amount of the food each day. This must be done under an allergist&aposs guidance. Other treatments, including allergy shots and probiotics, have not been proven to help with food allergies. If your child has a problem with cow&aposs milk formula, your provider may suggest trying a soy-based formula or something called an elemental formula, if it is available. If you have symptoms on only one area of the body, for example, a hive on the chin after eating the food, you may not need any treatment. The symptoms will likely go away in a brief time. Antihistamines may relieve the discomfort. Soothing skin creams may also provide some relief. If you have been diagnosed with a food allergy, learn how to use injectable epinephrine. You should have it with you at all times. If you develop any type of serious or whole-body reaction (even hives) after eating the food: - Inject the epinephrine. - Then go to the nearest hospital or emergency facility right away, preferably by ambulance.

So please can you tell me is there is any cure for milk products allergy, any cure? or any cure in the very near future? I will be very very very grateful if you replied, Thanks alot. :)	Penicillin allergy (Treatment): Interventions for a penicillin allergy can be divided into two general strategies: - Treatment for the current allergy symptoms - Desensitization to penicillin Treating current symptoms The following interventions may be used to treat the symptoms of an allergic reaction to penicillin: - Withdrawal of the drug. If your doctor determines that you have a penicillin allergy - or likely allergy - discontinuing the drug is the first step in treatment. - Antihistamines. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine or recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) that can block immune system chemicals activated during an allergic reaction. - Corticosteroids. Either oral or injected corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammation associated with more-serious reactions. - Treatment of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires an immediate epinephrine injection as well as hospital care to maintain blood pressure and support breathing. Drug desensitization If there are no other antibiotic treatment options available, your doctor may recommend a treatment called drug desensitization that would enable you to take a course of penicillin to treat an infection. With this treatment, you receive a very small dose and then progressively larger doses every 15 to 30 minutes over the course of several hours or a few days. If you can reach the desired dosage with no reaction, then you can continue the treatment. It&aposs important to take the drug as directed to maintain your tolerance to it during the entire course of treatment. If you need penicillin in the future, you will need to repeat the desensitization treatment. You&aposre carefully monitored during the intervention, and supportive care is available to treat reactions. Desensitization is rarely used if penicillin has caused a severe, life-threatening reaction in the past.

So please can you tell me is there is any cure for milk products allergy, any cure? or any cure in the very near future? I will be very very very grateful if you replied, Thanks alot. :)	Pet allergy (Treatment): The first line of treatment for controlling pet allergy is avoiding the allergy-causing animal as much as possible. When you minimize your exposure to pet allergens, you generally should expect to have allergic reactions that are less often or less severe. It&aposs often difficult or impossible to eliminate completely your exposure to animal allergens. Even if you don&apost have a pet, you may unexpectedly encounter pet allergens transported on other people&aposs clothes. In addition to avoiding pet allergens, you may need medications to control symptoms. Allergy medications Your doctor may direct you to take one of the following medications to improve nasal allergy symptoms: - Antihistamines reduce the production of an immune system chemical that is active in an allergic reaction, and they help relieve itching, sneezing and runny nose. Prescription antihistamines taken as a nasal spray include azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase). Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine tablets include fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy), loratadine (Claritin, Alavert) and cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy); OTC antihistamine syrups are available for children. Prescription antihistamine tablets, such as levocetirizine (Xyzal) and desloratadine (Clarinex), are other options. - Corticosteroids delivered as a nasal spray can reduce inflammation and control symptoms of hay fever. These drugs include (Flonase Allergy Relief), mometasone furoate (Nasonex), triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24-Hour) and ciclesonide (Omnaris). Nasal corticosteroids provide a low dose of the drug and have a much lower risk of side effects than do oral corticosteroids. - Decongestants can help shrink swollen tissues in your nasal passages and make it easier to breathe through your nose. Some over-the-counter allergy tablets combine an antihistamine with a decongestant. Oral decongestants can increase blood pressure and generally shouldn&apost be taken if you have high blood pressure, glaucoma or cardiovascular disease. Talk to your doctor about whether you can safely take a decongestant. Over-the-counter decongestants taken as a nasal spray may briefly reduce allergy symptoms. If you use a decongestant spray for more than three days in a row, it can contribute to congestion. - Leukotriene modifiers block the action of certain immune system chemicals. Your doctor may prescribe montelukast (Singulair), a prescription tablet, if corticosteroid nasal sprays or antihistamines are not good options for you. Possible side effects of montelukast include upper respiratory infection, headache and fever. Less common side effects include behavior or mood changes, such as anxiousness or depression. Other treatments - Immunotherapy. You can "train" your immune system not to be sensitive to an allergen. This is done through a series of allergy shots called immunotherapy. One to two weekly shots expose you to very small doses of the allergen, in this case, the animal protein that causes an allergic reaction. The dose is gradually increased, usually during a four- to six-month period. Maintenance shots are needed every four weeks for three to five years. Immunotherapy is usually used when other simple treatments aren&apost satisfactory. - Nasal irrigation. You can use a neti pot or a specially designed squeeze bottle to flush thickened mucus and irritants from your sinuses with a prepared saltwater (saline) rinse. If you&aposre preparing the saline solution yourself, use water that&aposs contaminant-free - distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered with a filter that has an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller. Be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with contaminant-free water, and leave open to air-dry.

For mild cases, simply avoiding the sun for a few days may be enough to resolve the signs and symptoms. Medications Creams containing corticosteroids are available over-the-counter and in stronger prescription form. For a severe allergic skin reaction, your doctor might prescribe a short course of corticosteroid pills, such as prednisone. The malaria medication hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may ease symptoms of some types of sun allergies. Therapy If you have a severe sun allergy, your doctor might suggest gradually getting your skin used to sunlight each spring. In phototherapy, a special lamp is used to shine ultraviolet light on areas of your body that are often exposed to the sun. It&aposs generally done a few times a week over several weeks.

I will be very very very grateful if you replied, Thanks alot. :)	Radiation therapy (Radiation therapy, Radiotherapy , Cancer - radiation therapy , Radiation therapy - radioactive seeds , Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) , Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) , Radiosurgery-radiation therapy , Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)-radiation therapy , Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)-radiation therapy , Intraoperative radiotherapy , Proton radiotherapy-radiation therapy): Radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death. Radiation therapy is used to fight many types of cancer. Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed. It may also be used in combination with other therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy to: Shrink a tumor as much as possible before surgery Help prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery or chemotherapy Relieve symptoms caused by a tumor, such as pain, pressure, or bleeding Treat cancers that cannot be removed with surgery TYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY Different types of radiation therapy include external, internal, and intraoperative. EXTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY External radiation is the most common form. This method carefully aims high-powered x-rays or particles directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Newer methods provide more effective treatment with less tissue damage. These include: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) Stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) Proton therapy is another kind of radiation used to treat cancer. Rather than using x-rays to destroy cancer cells, proton therapy uses a beam of special particles called protons. Because it causes less damage to healthy tissue, proton therapy is often used for cancers that are very close to critical parts of the body. It is only used for certain types of cancer. INTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY Internal beam radiation is placed inside your body. One method uses radioactive seeds that are placed directly into or near the tumor. This method is called brachytherapy, and is used to treat prostate cancer. It is used less often to treat breast, cervical, lung, and other cancers. Another method involves receiving radiation by drinking it, swallowing a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. Thyroid cancer may be treated this way. INTRAOPERTIVE RADIATION THERAPY (IORT) This type of radiation is usually used during surgery to remove a tumor. Right after the tumor is removed and before the surgeon closes the incision, radiation is delivered to the site where the tumor used to be. IORT is generally used for tumors that have not spread and microscopic tumor cells may remain after the larger tumor is removed. Compared with external radiation, advantages of IORT may include: Only the tumor area is targeted so there is less harm to healthy tissue Only a single dose of radiation is given Delivers a smaller dose of radiation SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation, and how often you have the therapy. External beam radiation may cause skin changes, such as hair loss, red or burning skin, thinning of skin tissue, or even shedding of the outer layer of skin. Other side effects depend on the part of body receiving radiation: Abdomen Brain Breast Chest Mouth and neck Pelvic (between the hips) Prostate Updated by: David Herold, MD, radiation oncologist in West Palm Beach, FL.

Based on how severe your ulcerative colitis is and how you respond to treatment, you may need to take one or more of these medicines: Anti-diarrhea drugs can help when you have very bad diarrhea. You can buy loperamide (Imodium) without a prescription. Always talk to your provider before using these drugs. Fiber supplements may help your symptoms. You can buy psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) without a prescription. Always talk to your provider before using any laxative medicines. You may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain. Drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your provider before taking these medicines. You may also need a prescription for stronger pain medicines. There are many types of drugs your provider may use to prevent or treat attacks of your ulcerative colitis.

NAME	Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

-1.7	ClinicalTrials.gov - Suggestion. Please help me with my brother with locked-in syndrome in Martinique for 3 years.Somebody please help. God bless . NAME	Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body&aposs immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider&aposs supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

[6] Supportive care for Leigh syndrome includes treatment of acidosis, seizures , dystonia , and cardiomyopathy , and attention to nutritional status. [4] [3] Because anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and bring on respiratory failure, careful consideration should be given to its use and close monitoring prior to, during, and after its use. [4] [3] Progression and new symptoms should be monitored regularly (typically every 6-12 months). Evaluations with a neurologist , ophthalmologist , audiologist , and cardiologist are recommended. [4] [3] Specific treatment is possible for the three nuclear gene -encoded Leigh-like syndromes (milder conditions with similar features). These include biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), biotinidase deficiency, and coenzyme Q10 deficiency caused by mutation of PDSS2.

Best Regards	Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome: Mitochondrial DNA -associated Leigh syndrome  is a progressive brain disorder that usually appears in infancy or early childhood. [1] Affected children may experience vomiting, seizures , delayed development, muscle weakness, and problems with movement. Heart disease, kidney problems, and difficulty breathing can also occur in people with this disorder. Mitochondrial DNA -associated Leigh syndrome is a subtype of Leigh syndrome and is caused by changes in mitochondrial DNA.  Mutations in at least 11 mitochondrial genes have been found to cause mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome. [2] This condition has an inheritance pattern known as maternal or mitochondrial inheritance . [2] [3] Because mitochondria can be passed from one generation to the next only through egg cells (not through sperm cells), only females pass mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome to their children. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

Best Regards	Leigh syndrome: Leigh syndrome is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition. It usually becomes apparent in infancy, often after a viral infection. Rarely, it begins in the teenage or adult years. Signs and symptoms usually progress rapidly. Early symptoms may include poor sucking ability; loss of head control and motor skills; loss of appetite; vomiting; and seizures . [1] As the condition progresses, symptoms may include weakness and lack of muscle tone; spasticity ; movement disorders; cerebellar ataxia; and peripheral neuropathy . Complications can lead to impairment of respiratory, heart and kidney function. [2] The term "Leigh-like syndrome" is often used for people with features that are strongly suggestive of Leigh syndrome but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. [3]  The inheritance of Leigh syndrome depends on where the responsible gene is located in each case. This is because it can be due to  mutations  in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA : [3] [2] [4] Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome follows a mitochondrial inheritance pattern (also called maternal inheritance). Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive  or X-linked manner. Treatment is based on the symptoms present and depends on the type of Leigh syndrome a person has. [2] [4] While life expectancy depends on the cause of Leigh syndrome in each person, most do not survive past mid-childhood or adolescence. [1] The symptoms of Leigh syndrome vary greatly from person to person. Very rarely, affected people with near-normal neurologic findings have been reported. Most people with Leigh syndrome have  central nervous system  and peripheral nervous system abnormalities, without involvement of other body systems. [5] Central nervous system abnormalities may include: [1] [5] Developmental delay or regression Nystagmus Ophthalmoparesis (weakness in the muscles that control eye movement) Optic atrophy Ataxia Dysphagia Retinitis pigmentosa Deafness Peripheral nervous system abnormalities may include polyneuropathy and myopathy. Although most people with Leigh syndrome only have neurological abnormalities, some people also have non-neurologic abnormalities. These may include:[5] Distinct physical features Hormone abnormalities resulting in short stature or hypertrichosis Heart abnormalities (hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy) Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in any of more than 75 different genes . Most of our genes are made up of DNA in the cell &aposs nucleus ( nuclear DNA). Some of our genes are made up of DNA in other cell structures called mitochondria ( mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA). Most people with Leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear DNA, and about 20% have a mutation in mtDNA. Most genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria (oxidative phosphorylation). Five protein  complexes, named complex I through complex IV, are involved in this process. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome disrupt the function of proteins in these complexes, how the complexes form, or additional steps related to energy production. Researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation may cause cells to die because they don&apost have enough energy. The death of brain cells likely contributes to the neurologic features of the condition, while the death of cells in other tissues may lead to additional symptoms in other parts of the body. [2] More information about the genes responsible for Leigh syndrome is available here on the Genetics Home Reference website. Leigh syndrome can be inherited in different ways depending on the location of the responsible gene in each person. [2] It is most commonly inherited in an  autosomal recessive  manner. [2] This means that to be affected, a person must have a  mutation  in both copies of the responsible  gene in each cell . Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a  carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% chance to be affected 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not a carrier Autosomal recessive inheritance applies to most of the associated genes in nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome. [2] In about 20% of cases, when Leigh syndrome is due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA ( mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome), it is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern. [2] This is also called maternal inheritance. Only egg cells, but not sperm cells, pass mitochondria on to children. This means that children can inherit mtDNA mutations from their mother only. This type of Leigh syndrome can occur in every generation of a family, and can affect males and females. However, affected males do not pass the condition on to their children. The father of an affected child is not at risk of having the mtDNA mutation, but the mother of an affected child usually has the mutation and may or may not have symptoms. In some cases, an mtDNA mutation occurs for the first time in an affected person and is not inherited. This is called a  de novo mutation. In a few cases of Leigh syndrome due to mutations in nuclear DNA , inheritance is X-linked recessive . [2] X-linked recessive conditions usually occur in males, who only have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome ). Females have two X chromosomes , so if they have a gene mutation on one of them, they still have a normal copy on their other X chromosome. For this reason, females are typically unaffected. While females can have an X-linked recessive condition, it is very rare. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive condition and the father is not, the risk to children depends on each child&aposs sex. Each son has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be affected Each daughter has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier If a father has the condition and the mother is not a carrier, all sons will be unaffected, and all daughters will be unaffected carriers. Leigh syndrome may be diagnosed by using the following criteria, defined by Rahman et al. in 1996: [3] Progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay Signs and symptoms of brainstem and/or basal ganglia disease Raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) The presence of one or more of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging ( CT scan or MRI ) Typical nervous system tissue changes Typical nervous system tissue changes in a similarly affected sibling After these criteria are met and a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome is made,  molecular genetic testing can then differentiate between  mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome (caused by mutations in mtDNA ) and  nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome (caused by mutations in nuclear DNA ). [3] A diagnosis of nuclear gene -encoded Leigh syndrome can be made either by identifying a mutation in nuclear DNA, or by excluding the presence of a mutation in mtDNA. [4] Because not all patients have increased lactate levels, recent studies proposed new diagnostic criteria excluding the raised lactate levels as a prerequisite. The remaining criteria are similar, but add mitochondrial dysfunction as a criterion. [3] A diagnosis of Leigh-like syndrome may be considered in individuals who do not meet the strict diagnostic criteria but have features resembling Leigh syndrome. [3]  Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Treatment of Leigh syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms present in each person. [6] Supportive care for Leigh syndrome includes treatment of acidosis, seizures , dystonia , and cardiomyopathy , and attention to nutritional status. [4] [3] Because anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and bring on respiratory failure, careful consideration should be given to its use and close monitoring prior to, during, and after its use. [4] [3] Progression and new symptoms should be monitored regularly (typically every 6-12 months). Evaluations with a neurologist , ophthalmologist , audiologist , and cardiologist are recommended. [4] [3] Specific treatment is possible for the three nuclear gene -encoded Leigh-like syndromes (milder conditions with similar features). These include biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), biotinidase deficiency, and coenzyme Q10 deficiency caused by mutation of PDSS2.

Best Regards	Leigh syndrome: Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that usually becomes apparent in the first year of life. This condition is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within two to three years, usually due to respiratory failure. A small number of individuals do not develop symptoms until adulthood or have symptoms that worsen more slowly. The first signs of Leigh syndrome seen in infancy are usually vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which disrupts eating. These problems often result in an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Severe muscle and movement problems are common in Leigh syndrome. Affected individuals may develop weak muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), common in people with Leigh syndrome, may also make movement difficult. Several other features may occur in people with Leigh syndrome. Many individuals with this condition develop weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoparesis); rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). Severe breathing problems are common, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. Some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. In addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, urine, or the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) of people with Leigh syndrome. The signs and symptoms of Leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. A medical procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain. These regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord and controls functions such as swallowing and breathing. The brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information from the rest of the body back to the brain. Leigh syndrome affects at least 1 in 40,000 newborns. The condition is more common in certain populations. For example, the condition occurs in approximately 1 in 2,000 newborns in the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada and in approximately 1 in 1,700 individuals on the Faroe Islands. Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of more than 75 different genes. In humans, most genes are found in DNA in the cell&aposs nucleus, called nuclear DNA. However, some genes are found in DNA in specialized structures in the cell called mitochondria. This type of DNA is known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). While most people with Leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear DNA, about 20 percent have a mutation in mtDNA. Most genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria. Mitochondria use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Five protein complexes, made up of several proteins each, are involved in this process. The complexes are named complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and complex V. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes drive the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell&aposs main energy source, through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome affect proteins in these complexes or disrupt their assembly. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of one or more of these complexes, which can lead to Leigh syndrome. Disruption of complex I, also called NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome, accounting for nearly one third of cases of the condition. At least 25 genes involved in the formation of complex I, found in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, have been associated with Leigh syndrome. Disruption of complex IV, also called cytochrome c oxidase or COX, is also a common cause of Leigh syndrome, underlying approximately 15 percent of cases. One of the most frequently mutated genes in Leigh syndrome is SURF1. This gene, which is found in nuclear DNA, provides instructions for making a protein that helps assemble the COX protein complex (complex IV). This complex, which is involved in the last step of electron transfer in oxidative phosphorylation, provides the energy that will be used in the next step of the process to generate ATP. Mutations in the SURF1 gene typically lead to an abnormally short SURF1 protein that is broken down in cells, resulting in the absence of functional SURF1 protein. The loss of this protein reduces the formation of normal COX complexes, which impairs mitochondrial energy production. The most common mtDNA mutation in Leigh syndrome affects the MT-ATP6 gene, which provides instructions for making a piece of complex V, also known as the ATP synthase protein complex. Using the energy provided by the other protein complexes, the ATP synthase complex generates ATP. MT-ATP6 gene mutations, found in approximately 10 percent of people with Leigh syndrome, block the generation of ATP. Other mtDNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or lead to reduced formation of mitochondrial proteins, all of which impair mitochondrial energy production. Other gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of one or more oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or affect additional steps related to energy production. For example, Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in genes that form the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or coenzyme Q10, both of which are involved in mitochondrial energy production. Mutations in genes that direct the replication of mtDNA or the production of mitochondrial proteins can also disrupt mitochondrial energy production. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death because of decreased energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death in the brain likely causes the characteristic lesions seen in Leigh syndrome, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of the condition. Cell death in other sensitive tissues may also contribute to the features of Leigh syndrome. Leigh syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. It is most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. This pattern of inheritance applies to most of the Leigh syndrome-associated genes contained in nuclear DNA, including SURF1. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In approximately 20 percent of people with Leigh syndrome, the condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtDNA, including MT-ATP6. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations only from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children. Occasionally, mutations in mtDNA occur spontaneously, and there is no history of Leigh syndrome in the family. In a small number of affected individuals with mutations in nuclear DNA, Leigh syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The condition has this pattern of inheritance when the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. Finsterer J. Leigh and Leigh-like syndrome in children and adults.

Best Regards	IMH » Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Treatment and Therapies): While there is no cure for ADHD, currently available treatments can help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. Medication For many people, ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn. Medication also may improve physical coordination. Sometimes several different medications or dosages must be tried before finding the right one that works for a particular person. Anyone taking medications must be monitored closely and carefully by their prescribing doctor. Stimulants. The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a "stimulant." Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works because it increases the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. Under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe. However, there are risks and side effects, especially when misused or taken in excess of the prescribed dose.For example, stimulants can raise blood pressure and heart rate and increase anxiety. Therefore, a person with other health problems, including high blood pressure, seizures, heart disease, glaucoma, liver or kidney disease, or an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor before taking a stimulant. Talk with a doctor if you see any of these side effects while taking stimulants: decreased appetite sleep problems tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds); personality changes increased anxiety and irritability stomachaches headaches Non-stimulants. A few other ADHD medications are non-stimulants. These medications take longer to start working than stimulants, but can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. Doctors may prescribe a non-stimulant: when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; or in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness. Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of ADHD, some antidepressants are sometimes used alone or in combination with a stimulant to treat ADHD. Antidepressants may help all of the symptoms of ADHD and can be prescribed if a patient has bothersome side effects from stimulants. Antidepressants can be helpful in combination with stimulants if a patient also has another condition, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or another mood disorder. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication, dose, or medication combination. Learn the basics about stimulants and other mental health medications on the NIMH Mental Health Medications webpage and check the FDAwebsite (http://www.fda.gov/), for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Psychotherapy Adding psychotherapy to treat ADHD can help patients and their families to better cope with everyday problems. Behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help a person change his or her behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events. Behavioral therapy also teaches a person how to: monitor his or her own behavior give oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting Parents, teachers, and family members also can give positive or negative feedback for certain behaviors and help establish clear rules, chore lists, and other structured routines to help a person control his or her behavior. Therapists may also teach children social skills, such as how to wait their turn, share toys, ask for help, or respond to teasing. Learning to read facial expressions and the tone of voice in others, and how to respond appropriately can also be part of social skills training. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also teach a person mindfulness techniques, or meditation. A person learns how to be aware and accepting of one&aposs own thoughts and feelings to improve focus and concentration. The therapist also encourages the person with ADHD to adjust to the life changes that come with treatment, such as thinking before acting, or resisting the urge to take unnecessary risks. Family and marital therapy can help family members and spouses find better ways to handle disruptive behaviors, to encourage behavior changes, and improve interactions with the patient. For more information on psychotherapy, see the Psychotherapies webpage on the NIMH website. Education and Training Children and adults with ADHD need guidance and understanding from their parents, families, and teachers to reach their full potential and to succeed. For school-age children, frustration, blame, and anger may have built up within a family before a child is diagnosed. Parents and children may need special help to overcome negative feelings. Mental health professionals can educate parents about ADHD and how it affects a family. They also will help the child and his or her parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other. Parenting skills training (behavioral parent management training) teaches parents the skills they need to encourage and reward positive behaviors in their children. It helps parents learn how to use a system of rewards and consequences to change a child&aposs behavior. Parents are taught to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want to encourage, and ignore or redirect behaviors that they want to discourage. They may also learn to structure situations in ways that support desired behavior. Stress management techniques can benefit parents of children with ADHD by increasing their ability to deal with frustration so that they can respond calmly to their child&aposs behavior. Support groups can help parents and families connect with others who have similar problems and concerns. Groups often meet regularly to share frustrations and successes, to exchange information about recommended specialists and strategies, and to talk with experts. Tips to Help Kids and Adults with ADHD Stay Organized For Kids: Parents and teachers can help kids with ADHD stay organized and follow directions with tools such as: Keeping a routine and a schedule. Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. Include times for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the schedule on the refrigerator or on a bulletin board in the kitchen. Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible. Organizing everyday items. Have a place for everything, and keep everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and toys. Using homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home the necessary books. Being clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they can understand and follow. Giving praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior, and praise it. For Adults: A professional counselor or therapist can help an adult with ADHD learn how to organize his or her life with tools such as: Keeping routines Making lists for different tasks and activities Using a calendar for scheduling events Using reminder notes Assigning a special place for keys, bills, and paperwork Breaking down large tasks into more manageable, smaller steps so that completing each part of the task provides a sense of accomplishment.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (Treatment): Though irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) doesn’t have a cure, your doctor can manage the symptoms with a combination of diet, medicines, probiotics, and therapies for mental health problems. You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment plan.Changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, such as following a FODMAP diet, can help treat your symptoms.Your doctor may recommend medicine to relieve your symptoms.Fiber supplements to relieve constipation when increasing fiber in your diet doesn’t help. Laxatives to help with constipation. Laxatives work in different ways, and your doctor can recommend a laxative that’s right for you. Loperamide to reduce diarrhea by slowing the movement of stool through your colon. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that reduces diarrhea in people with IBS, though it doesn’t reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce pain in your abdomen.  Antidepressants, such as low doses of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, to relieve IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. In theory, because of their effect on colon transit, tricyclic antidepressants should be better for people with IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be better for people with IBS with constipation, or IBS-C, although studies haven’t confirmed this theory. Tricyclic antidepressants work in people with IBS by reducing their sensitivity to pain in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as normalizing their GI motility and secretion. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) for people who have IBS-C to improve abdominal pain or discomfort and constipation symptoms.  Linaclotide (Linzess) for people who have IBS-C to relieve abdominal pain and increase how often you have bowel movements.

Ask your doctor and your pharmacist about side effects before taking any medicine. MedlinePlus maintains the latest information about side effects and drug warnings.Your doctor may also recommend probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms—tiny organisms that can be seen only with a microscope. These microorganisms, most often bacteria, are like the microorganisms that are normally present in your GI tract. Studies have found that taking large enough amounts of probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, can improve symptoms of IBS. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.You can find probiotics in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt.Discuss your use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including probiotics and dietary supplements, with your doctor.Psychological therapies may improve your IBS symptoms.Managing StressLearning to reduce stress can help improve IBS. With less stress, you may find you have less cramping and pain. You may also find it easier to manage your symptoms.Some options for managing stress includetaking part in stress reduction and relaxation therapies such as meditation getting counseling and support taking part in regular exercise such as walking or yoga reducing stressful life situations as much as possible getting enough sleepTalk TherapyTalk therapy may reduce stress and improve your IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy that health care professionals use to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on your thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how your emotions affect your IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques.Gut-Directed HypnotherapyIn gut-directed hypnotherapy, a therapist uses hypnosis to help you relax the muscles in the colon.Mindfulness TrainingMindfulness training can teach you to focus your attention on sensations occurring at the moment and to avoid catastrophizing, or worrying about the meaning of those sensations.

What to do for Losing weight after pregnancy?: DO NOT go on a crash diet (not eating enough) or a fad diet (popular diets that limit certain types of foods and nutrients). They will probably make you drop pounds at first. But those first few pounds you lose are fluid and will come back. Other pounds you lose on a crash diet may be muscle instead of fat. You will gain back any fat you lose on a crash diet once you return to normal eating.

My father is suffering from IBS and is losing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (How can my diet treat the symptoms of IBS?): Eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help your irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea if you have IBS.Eating foods that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables, may help.Fiber may improve constipation symptoms caused by IBS because it makes stool soft and easier to pass. Fiber is a part of foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services state in its Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (PDF, 2.963 MB) that adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.3While fiber may help constipation, it may not reduce the abdominal discomfort or pain of IBS. In fact, some people with IBS may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Add foods with fiber to your diet a little at a time to let your body get used to them. Too much fiber at once can cause gas, which can trigger symptoms in people with IBS. Adding fiber to your diet slowly, by 2 to 3 grams a day, may help prevent gas and bloating.

Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare (Diet): Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone. - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating. This will help you look for a pattern of foods that may make your symptoms worse. - Avoid foods that cause symptoms. These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley. - Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones. Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly.

Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. Your health care provider will talk about things you can do at home to manage your condition. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be a lifelong condition. You may be suffering from cramping and loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, or some combination of these symptoms. For some people, IBS symptoms may interfere with work, travel, and attending social events. But taking medicines and making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone. - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating.

Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly. No one drug will work for everyone. Medicines your provider may have you try include: - Antispasmodic medicines that you take before eating to control colon muscle spasms and abdominal cramping - Antidiarrheal medicines such as loperamide - Laxatives, such as lubiprostone, bisacodyl , and other ones bought without a prescription - Antidepressants to help relieve pain or discomfort - Rifaximin, an antibiotic that is not absorbed from your intestines It is very important to follow your provider&aposs instructions when using medicines for IBS. Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems. Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including: - Not being able to do activities because of your pain - Changes or problems at work or at home - A busy schedule - Spending too much time alone - Having other medical problems A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed. - Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry. - Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations. - Reach out to other people. - Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including pain or discomfort in your abdomen and changes in your bowel movement patterns—that occur together. Doctors call IBS a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Functional GI disorders happen when your GI tract behaves in an abnormal way without evidence of damage due to a disease.In the past, doctors called IBS colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel. Experts changed the name to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and isn’t a product of a person’s imagination.

Experts changed the name to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and isn’t a product of a person’s imagination. Doctors often classify IBS into one of four types based on your usual stool consistency. These types are important because they affect the types of treatment that are most likely to improve your symptoms.The four types of IBS areIBS with constipation, or IBS-C hard or lumpy stools at least 25 percent of the time loose or watery stools less than 25 percent of the time IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D loose or watery stools at least 25 percent of the time hard or lumpy stools less than 25 percent of the time Mixed IBS, or IBS-M hard or lumpy stools at least 25 percent of the time loose or watery stools at least 25 percent of the time Unsubtyped IBS, or IBS-U hard or lumpy stools less than 25 percent of the time loose or watery stools less than 25 percent of the time Studies estimate that IBS affects 10 to 15 percent of U.S. adults.1 However, only 5 to 7 percent of U.S. adults have received a diagnosis of IBS.2 IBS affects about twice as many women as men and most often occurs in people younger than age 45.1 People with IBS often suffer from other GI and non-GI conditions. GI conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia are more common in people with IBS than the general population.Non-GI conditions that people with IBS often have includechronic fatigue syndrome chronic pelvic pain temporomandibular joint disorders depression anxiety somatoform disorders The most common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) include pain or discomfort in your abdomen and changes in how often you have bowel movements or how your stools look. The pain or discomfort of IBS may feel like cramping and have at least two of the following:Your pain or discomfort improves after a bowel movement. You notice a change in how often you have a bowel movement. You notice a change in the way your stools look.IBS is a chronic disorder, meaning it lasts a long time, often years. However, the symptoms may come and go. You may have IBS if:You’ve had symptoms at least three times a month for the past 3 months. Your symptoms first started at least 6 months ago.People with IBS may have diarrhea, constipation, or both. Some people with IBS have only diarrhea or only constipation. Some people have symptoms of both or have diarrhea sometimes and constipation other times. People often have symptoms soon after eating a meal.Other symptoms of IBS arebloating the feeling that you haven’t finished a bowel movement whitish mucus in your stoolWomen with IBS often have more symptoms during their menstrual periods.While IBS can be painful, IBS doesn’t lead to other health problems or damage your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Doctors aren’t sure what causes IBS. Experts think that a combination of problems can lead to IBS.Brain-Gut Signal ProblemsSignals between your brain and the nerves of your gut, or small and large intestines, control how your gut works. Problems with brain-gut signals may cause IBS symptoms.GI Motility ProblemsIf you have IBS, you may not have normal motility in your colon. Slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. Spasms can cause abdominal pain. If you have IBS, you may also experience hyperreactivity—a dramatic increase in bowel contractions when you feel stress or after you eat.Pain SensitivityIf you have IBS, the nerves in your gut may be extra sensitive, causing you to feel more pain or discomfort than normal when gas or stool is in your gut. Your brain may process pain signals from your bowel differently if you have IBS.InfectionsA bacterial infection in the GI tract may cause some people to develop IBS. Researchers don’t know why infections in the GI tract lead to IBS in some people and not others, although abnormalities of the GI tract lining and mental health problems may play a role.Small Intestinal Bacterial OvergrowthNormally, few bacteria live in your small intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number or a change in the type of bacteria in your small intestine. These bacteria can produce extra gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Some experts think small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may lead to IBS. Research continues to explore a possible link between the two conditions.Neurotransmitters (Body Chemicals)People with IBS have altered levels of neurotransmitters—chemicals in the body that transmit nerve signals—and GI hormones. The role these chemicals play in IBS is unclear.Younger women with IBS often have more symptoms during their menstrual periods. Post-menopausal women have fewer symptoms compared with women who are still menstruating. These findings suggest that reproductive hormones can worsen IBS problems.GeneticsWhether IBS has a genetic cause, meaning it runs in families, is unclear. Studies have shown IBS is more common in people with family members who have a history of GI problems.Food SensitivityMany people with IBS report that foods rich in carbohydrates, spicy or fatty foods, coffee, and alcohol trigger their symptoms. However, people with food sensitivity typically don’t have signs of a food allergy. Researchers think that poor absorption of sugars or bile acids may cause symptoms.Psychological, or mental health, problems such as panic disorder, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in people with IBS. The link between mental health and IBS is unclear. GI disorders, including IBS, are sometimes present in people who have reported past physical or sexual abuse. Experts think people who have been abused tend to express psychological stress through physical symptoms.If you have IBS, your colon may respond too much to even slight conflict or stress. Stress makes your mind more aware of the sensations in your colon. IBS symptoms can also increase your stress level. Your doctor may be able to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on a review of your medical history, symptoms, and physical exam. Your doctor may also order tests.To diagnose IBS, your doctor will take a complete medical history and perform a physical exam.The medical history will include questions aboutyour symptoms family history of gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders recent infections medicines stressful events related to the start of your symptomsYour doctor will look for a certain pattern in your symptoms. Your doctor may diagnose IBS ifyour symptoms started at least 6 months ago you’ve had pain or discomfort in your abdomen at least three times a month for the past 3 months your abdominal pain or discomfort has two or three of the following features: Your pain or discomfort improves after a bowel movement. You notice a change in how often you have a bowel movement.

Your doctor may perform more tests based on the results of the blood test and if you havea family history of celiac disease, colon cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease a fever anemia bleeding from your rectum weight lossDoctors use blood tests to check for conditions or problems other than IBS. A health care professional sends your blood sample to a lab.A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. Your doctor will give you a container for catching and holding a stool sample. You will receive instructions on where to send or take the kit for analysis, to check for blood or parasites. Your doctor may also check for blood in your stool by examining your rectum during your physical exam.Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a procedure that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera (called a sigmoidoscope) on one end to look inside your rectum and lower colon.This procedure can show signs of conditions or problems in the lower GI tract. During the procedure, the doctor can take a biopsy. You won’t feel the biopsy.Colonoscopy is a procedure that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera (called a colonoscope) on one end to look inside your rectum and colon.Colonoscopy can show irritated or swollen tissue, ulcers, polyps, and cancer. A trained specialist performs this procedure.A lower GI series, also called a Barium Enema, uses x-rays to look at your large intestine.During a lower GI series, you’ll be asked to lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. The doctor will fill your large intestine with barium. You may be asked to change positions several times during the test.

My father is suffering from IBS and is losing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable bowel syndrome: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. IBS is not the same as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The reasons why IBS develops are not clear. It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress. The intestine is connected to the brain using hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. IBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men.  It is less likely to begin in older people above 50 years of age. About 10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist). IBS symptoms vary from person to person, and range from mild to severe. Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more. The main symptoms include: - Abdominal pain - Gas - Fullness - Bloating - Change in bowel habits. Can have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C). Pain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements. People with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other. - If you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools. You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control. - If you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass. The symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time. You may also lose your appetite if you have IBS. However, blood in stools and unintentional weight loss are not a part of IBS. There is no test to diagnose IBS. Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose IBS based on your symptoms. Eating a lactose-free diet for 2 weeks may help the provider identify lactase deficiency (or lactose intolerance). The following tests may be done to rule out other problems: - Blood tests to see if you have celiac disease or a low blood count (anemia) - Stool cultures to check for an infection Your provider may recommend a colonoscopy. During this test, a flexible tube is inserted through the anus to examine the colon. You may need this test if: - Symptoms began later in life (over age 50) - You have symptoms such as weight loss or bloody stools - You have abnormal blood tests (such as a low blood count) Other disorders that can cause similar symptoms include: - Celiac disease - Colon cancer (cancer rarely causes typical IBS symptoms, unless symptoms such as weight loss, blood in the stools, or abnormal blood tests are also present) - Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. In some cases of IBS, lifestyle changes can help. For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms. Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another. The following changes may help: - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas) - Eating smaller meals - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse) Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines. No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include: - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms - Bisacodyl to treat constipation - Loperamide to treat diarrhea - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms - Rifaximin, an antibiotic Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem. IBS may be a life-long condition. For some people, symptoms are disabling and interfere with work, travel, and social activities. Symptoms often get better with treatment. IBS does not cause permanent harm to the intestines. Also, it does not lead to a serious disease, such as cancer. Call your provider if you have symptoms of IBS or if you notice changes in your bowel habits that do not go away. Updated by: Michael M.

Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body&aposs immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider&aposs supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

Crohn disease - discharge (Drug Treatment): Your provider may give you some drugs to help relieve your symptoms. Based on how bad your Crohn disease is and how you respond to treatment, your provider may recommend one or more of these drugs: Anti-diarrhea drugs can help when you have very bad diarrhea. Loperamide (Imodium) can be bought without a prescription. Always talk to your provider before using these drugs. Fiber supplements may help your symptoms. You can buy psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) without a prescription. Ask your provider about these. Always talk to your provider before using any laxative medicines. You may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain. Drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your provider about medicines you can use. You may need a prescription for stronger pain medicines. There are many types of drugs that can help prevent or treat attacks of your Crohn disease.

Gastroesophageal reflux - discharge (Drug Treatment): Antacids can help neutralize your stomach acid. They do not help to treat the irritation in your esophagus. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation. Other over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids but give you longer relief. Your provider can tell you how to take these drugs. There are two different types of these drugs: H2 antagonists: famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid) Proton pump inhibitors (PPI): omeprazole (Prilosec or Zegarid), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and pantoprazole (Protonix)

I&aposm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him.Thank you	Lung cancer (Diagnosis): Testing healthy people for lung cancer People with an increased risk of lung cancer may consider annual lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scans. Lung cancer screening is generally offered to people 55 and older who smoked heavily for many years and are otherwise healthy. Discuss your lung cancer risk with your doctor. Together you can decide whether lung cancer screening is right for you. Tests to diagnose lung cancer If there&aposs reason to think that you may have lung cancer, your doctor can order a number of tests to look for cancerous cells and to rule out other conditions. Tests may include: - Imaging tests. An X-ray image of your lungs may reveal an abnormal mass or nodule. A CT scan can reveal small lesions in your lungs that might not be detected on an X-ray. - Sputum cytology. If you have a cough and are producing sputum, looking at the sputum under the microscope can sometimes reveal the presence of lung cancer cells. - Tissue sample (biopsy). A sample of abnormal cells may be removed in a procedure called a biopsy. Your doctor can perform a biopsy in a number of ways, including bronchoscopy, in which your doctor examines abnormal areas of your lungs using a lighted tube that&aposs passed down your throat and into your lungs; mediastinoscopy, in which an incision is made at the base of your neck and surgical tools are inserted behind your breastbone to take tissue samples from lymph nodes; and needle biopsy, in which your doctor uses X-ray or CT images to guide a needle through your chest wall and into the lung tissue to collect suspicious cells. A biopsy sample may also be taken from lymph nodes or other areas where cancer has spread, such as your liver. Careful analysis of your cancer cells in a lab will reveal what type of lung cancer you have. Results of sophisticated testing can tell your doctor the specific characteristics of your cells that can help determine your prognosis and guide your treatment. Tests to determine the extent of the cancer Once your lung cancer has been diagnosed, your doctor will work to determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer&aposs stage helps you and your doctor decide what treatment is most appropriate. Staging tests may include imaging procedures that allow your doctor to look for evidence that cancer has spread beyond your lungs. These tests include CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) and bone scans. Not every test is appropriate for every person, so talk with your doctor about which procedures are right for you. The stages of lung cancer are indicated by Roman numerals that range from 0 to IV, with the lowest stages indicating cancer that is limited to the lung. By stage IV, the cancer is considered advanced and has spread to other areas of the body.

Staging helps determine where the original tumor is, how big it is, whether it has spread, and where it has spread. Cancer staging can help your health care provider: - Determine your prognosis (chance of recovery or likelihood the cancer will come back) - Plan your treatment - Identify clinical trials you may be able to join Staging also gives providers a common language to use to describe and discuss cancer. How Cancer Is Staged : Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. These cells often form a tumor. This tumor can grow into the surrounding tissues and organs. As the cancer progresses, cancer cells from the tumor can break away and spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymph system. When cancer spreads, tumors can form in other organs and parts of the body. The spread of cancer is called metastasis. Cancer staging is used to help describe the progression of cancer. It helps determine: - Location of the primary (original) tumor and type of cancer cells - Size of the primary tumor - Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes - Number of tumors from the cancer that has spread - Tumor grade (how much cancer cells look like normal cells) To assess your cancer, your provider may perform different tests, depending on where the cancer is in your body. These may include: - Imaging tests, such as x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, or MRIs - Lab tests - Biopsy You also may have surgery to remove the cancer and lymph nodes or to explore the cancer in your body and take a tissue sample. These samples are tested and can provide more detailed information about the cancer stage. TNM Staging System : The most common system for staging cancer in the form of solid tumor is the TNM system. Most providers and cancer centers use it to stage most cancers. The TNM system is based on: - The size of the primary tumor (T) - How much cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N) - Metastasis (M), or if and how much the cancer has spread to other areas in the body Numbers are added to each category that explain the size of the tumor and how much it has spread. The higher the number, the greater the size and the more likely cancer has spread. Primary Tumor (T): - TX: The tumor cannot be measured - T0: The tumor cannot be found - Tis: Abnormal cells have been found, but have not spread. This is called carcinoma in situ. - T1, T2, T3, T4: Indicate the size of the primary tumor and how much it has spread into surrounding tissue. Lymph Nodes (N): - NX: Lymph nodes cannot be evaluated - N0: No cancer found in nearby lymph nodes - N1, N2, N3: Number and location of lymph nodes involved where cancer has spread Metastasis (M): - MX: Metastasis cannot be evaluated - M0: No metastasis found (cancer has not spread) - M1: Metastasis is found (cancer has spread to other parts of the body) As an example, a bladder cancer T3 N0 M0 means there is a large tumor (T3) that has not spread to lymph nodes (N0) or anywhere else in the body (M0). Sometimes other letters and sub-categories are used in addition to the ones above. A tumor grade, such as G1-G4 can also be used along with staging. This describes how much cancer cells look like normal cells under a microscope. Higher numbers indicate abnormal cells. The less the cancer looks like normal cells, the faster it will grow and spread. Not all cancers are staged using the TNM system. That is because some cancers, especially blood and bone marrow cancer such as leukemia, do not form tumors or spread in the same way. So other systems are used to stage these cancers. Assigning a Stage : A stage is assigned to your cancer based on the TNM values and other factors. Different cancers are staged differently. For instance, stage III colon cancer is not the same as a stage III bladder cancer. In general, a higher stage refers to more advanced cancer. - Stage 0: Abnormal cells are present, but have not spread - Stage I, II, III: Refer to size of tumor and how much cancer has spread to lymph nodes - Stage IV: Disease has spread to other organs and tissues. Once your cancer has been assigned a stage, it does not change, even if the cancer does come back. A cancer is staged based on what is found when it is diagnosed.

I&aposm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him.Thank you	Lung cancer (Exams and Tests): Lung cancer is often found when an x-ray or CT scan is done for another reason. If lung cancer is suspected, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked if you smoke. If so, you&aposll be asked how much you smoke and for how long you have smoked. You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk of lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may hear fluid around the lungs. This may suggest cancer. Tests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or see if it has spread include: - Bone scan - Chest x-ray - Complete blood count (CBC) - CT scan of the chest - MRI of the chest - Positron emission tomography (PET) scan - Sputum test to look for cancer cells - Thoracentesis (sampling of fluid buildup around the lung) In most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do this: - Bronchoscopy combined with biopsy - CT-scan-directed needle biopsy - Endoscopic esophageal ultrasound (EUS) with biopsy - Mediastinoscopy with biopsy - Open lung biopsy - Pleural biopsy If the biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up and gives you an idea of what to expect.

The lungs bring oxygen into the body when breathing in and send carbon dioxide out of the body when breathing out. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. The types are based on the way the cells look under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer is much more common than small cell lung cancer. Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the U.S. For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. - Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. - There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer. - Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. - Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn&apost go away and shortness of breath. - Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. - Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. - There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer. - Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. - Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn&apost go away and shortness of breath. - Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. - After lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer: - Occult (hidden) stage - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IV - After lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer: - Occult (hidden) stage - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IV - There are different types of treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. - Nine types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - Laser therapy - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) - Cryosurgery - Electrocautery - Watchful waiting - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Chemoprevention - Radiosensitizers - New combinations - Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. - There are different types of treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. - Nine types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - Laser therapy - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) - Cryosurgery - Electrocautery - Watchful waiting - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Chemoprevention - Radiosensitizers - New combinations - Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed.

My question is...testing her and comparing her tests with my husbands and his sisters test help to determine if it is genetic? My mother in law and her mother and her mothers sister both had lung cancer and none if them were smokers. I&aposm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him.Thank you	Solitary pulmonary nodule (Exams and Tests): A solitary pulmonary nodule is most often found on a chest x-ray or chest CT scan. These imaging tests are often done for other symptoms or reasons. Your health care provider must decide whether the nodule in your lung is most likely benign or of concern. A nodule more likely benign if: The nodule is small, has a smooth border, and has a solid and even appearance on an x-ray or CT scan. You are young and do not smoke. Your provider may then choose to monitor the nodule over time by repeating a series of x-rays or CT scans. Repeat chest x-rays or chest CT scans are the most common way to monitor the nodule. Sometimes, lung PET scans may be done. If repeated x-rays show that the nodule size has not changed in 2 years, it is most likely benign and a biopsy is not needed. Your provider may choose to biopsy the nodule to rule out cancer if: You are a smoker. You have other symptoms of lung cancer. The nodule has grown in size or has changed when compared to earlier images. A lung needle biopsy may be done by placing a needle directly through the wall of your chest, or during procedures called bronchoscopy or mediastinoscopy. Tests to rule out TB and other infections may also be done.

My mother in law and her mother and her mothers sister both had lung cancer and none if them were smokers. I&aposm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him.Thank you	Lung cancer (Lung cancer, Cancer - lung): Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it flows through tubes called bronchi. Most lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes. There are two main types of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up about 20% of all lung cancer cases. If the lung cancer is made up of both types, it is called mixed small cell/large cell cancer. If the cancer started somewhere else in the body and spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic cancer to the lung. Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk for lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Lung cancer can also affect people who have never smoked. Secondhand smoke (breathing the smoke of others) increases your risk for lung cancer. The following may also increase your risk for lung cancer: Exposure to asbestos Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Exposure to radon gas Family history of lung cancer High levels of air pollution High levels of arsenic in drinking water Radiation therapy to the lungs Early lung cancer may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have, but may include: Chest pain Cough that does not go away Coughing up blood Fatigue Losing weight without trying Loss of appetite Shortness of breath Wheezing Other symptoms that may also occur with lung cancer, often in the late stages: Bone pain or tenderness Eyelid drooping Facial paralysis Hoarseness or changing voice Joint pain Nail problems Shoulder pain Swallowing difficulty Swelling of the face or arms Weakness These symptoms can also be due to other, less serious conditions, so it is important to talk to your health care provider. Lung cancer is often found when an x-ray or CT scan is done for another reason. If lung cancer is suspected, the provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked if you smoke. If so, you&aposll be asked how much you smoke and for how long you have smoked. You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk for lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, the provider may hear fluid around the lungs. This may suggest cancer. Tests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or see if it has spread include: Bone scan Chest x-ray Complete blood count (CBC) CT scan of the chest MRI of the chest Positron emission tomography (PET) scan Sputum test to look for cancer cells Thoracentesis (sampling of fluid buildup around the lung) In most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do this: Bronchoscopy combined with biopsy CT-scan-directed needle biopsy Endoscopic esophageal ultrasound (EUS) with biopsy Mediastinoscopy with biopsy Open lung biopsy Pleural biopsy If the biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for lung cancer depends on the type of cancer, how advanced it is, and how healthy you are: Surgery to remove the tumor may be done when it has not spread beyond nearby lymph nodes. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. The above treatments may be done alone or in combination. Your provider can tell you more about the specific treatment you will receive, depending on the specific type of lung cancer and what stage it is. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well you do depends mostly on how much the lung cancer has spread. Call your provider if you have symptoms of lung cancer, particularly if you smoke. If you smoke, now is the time to quit. If you are having trouble quitting, talk with your provider. There are many methods to help you quit, from support groups to prescription medicines. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.

Your provider will be able to inspect your airways or take a biopsy sample. Common reasons to do a bronchoscopy for diagnosis are: An imaging test showed abnormal changes of your lung, such as a growth or tumor, changes or scarring of lung tissue, or collapse of one area of your lung. To biopsy lymph nodes near your lungs. To see why you are coughing up blood. To explain shortness of breath or low oxygen levels. To see if there is a foreign object in your airway. You have a cough that has lasted more than 3 months without any clear cause. You have an infection in your lungs and major airways (bronchi) that cannot be diagnosed any other way or need a certain type of diagnosis. You inhaled a toxic gas or chemical. To see if a lung rejection after a lung transplant is occurring. You may also have a bronchoscopy to treat a lung or airway problem. For example, it may be done to: Remove fluid or mucus plugs from your airways Remove a foreign object from your airways Widen (dilate) an airway that is blocked or narrowed Drain an abscess Treat cancer using a number of different techniques Wash out an airway

This area is called the pleural space. Cytology means the study of cells. A sample of fluid from the pleural space is needed. The sample is taken using a procedure called thoracentesis. The procedure is done in the following way: You sit on a bed or on the edge of a chair or bed. Your head and arms rest on a table. A small area of skin on your back is cleaned. Numbing medicine (local anesthetic) is injected in this area. The doctor inserts a needle through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the pleural space. Fluid is collected. The needle is removed. A bandage is placed on the skin. The fluid sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is examined under the microscope to determine what the cells look like and whether they are abnormal. No special preparation is needed before the test. A chest x-ray will likely be done before and after the test. DO NOT cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung. You will feel stinging when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pain or pressure when the needle is inserted into the pleural space. Tell your health care provider if you feel short of breath or have chest pain. A cytology exam is used to look for cancer and precancerous cells. It may also be done for other conditions, such as identifying systemic lupus erythematosus cells. Your doctor may order this test if you have signs of fluid buildup in the pleural space. This condition is called pleural effusion. The test may also be done if you have signs of lung cancer. Normal cells are seen. In an abnormal test, there are cancerous (malignant) cells. This may mean there is a cancerous tumor. This test most often detects: Breast cancer Lymphoma Lung cancer Ovarian cancer Stomach cancer Risks are related to thoracentesis and may include: Bleeding Infection Collapse of the lung (pneumothorax) Difficulty breathing Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

1.88888888889	Hello i would like more info about Familial Mediterean Fever please as my husband suffers from this. THANKS	Familial Mediterranean fever: Familial Mediterranean fever is an inflammatory disorder that causes recurrent fevers and painful inflammation of your abdomen, lungs and joints. Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited disorder that usually occurs in people of Mediterranean origin - including Sephardic Jews, Arabs, Greeks, Italians, Armenians and Turks. But it may affect any ethnic group. Familial Mediterranean fever is typically diagnosed during childhood. While there&aposs no cure for this disorder, you may be able to relieve signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever - or even prevent them altogether - by sticking to your treatment plan. Signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever usually begin during childhood. They occur in bouts called attacks that last one to three days. Arthritic attacks may last for weeks or months. Signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever include: - Fever - Abdominal pain - Chest pain - Achy, swollen joints - Constipation followed by diarrhea - A red rash on your legs, especially below your knees - Muscle aches - A swollen, tender scrotum Between attacks, you&aposll likely feel normal. Symptom-free periods may be as short as a few days or as long as several years. When to see a doctor If you or your child experiences sudden worrisome signs or symptoms, such as shortness of breath or passing out, call 911 or emergency medical help. See your doctor if you or your child has a sudden fever accompanied by pain in the abdomen, chest and joints. Familial Mediterranean fever is caused by a gene mutation that&aposs passed from parents to children. The gene mutation causes problems in regulating inflammation in the body. In people with familial Mediterranean fever, the gene mutation occurs in a gene called MEFV. Many different mutations in MEFV are linked to familial Mediterranean fever. Some mutations may cause very severe cases, while others may be milder. Factors that may increase the risk of familial Mediterranean fever include: - Having a family history of the disease. If you have a family history of familial Mediterranean fever, your risk of the disease is increased. - Being of Mediterranean ancestry. If your family can trace its history to the Mediterranean region, your risk of the disease may be increased. Familial Mediterranean fever can affect any ethnic group, but it may be more likely in Sephardic Jews, Arabs, Italians, Armenians and Turks. Tests and procedures used to diagnose familial Mediterranean fever include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may ask you about your signs and symptoms and conduct a physical exam to gather more information. - Review of your family medical history. A family history of familial Mediterranean fever increases your likelihood of developing the condition because this genetic mutation is passed from parents to their children. - Blood tests. During an attack, blood tests may show elevated levels of certain markers that indicate an inflammatory condition in your body. An elevated level of white blood cells, which fight infections, is one such marker. - Genetic testing. Genetic testing may determine if your MEFV gene contains a mutation that is associated with familial Mediterranean fever. Genetic tests aren&apost advanced enough to test for every gene mutation that&aposs linked to familial Mediterranean fever, so there is a possibility of false-negative results. For this reason, doctors typically don&apost use genetic tests as the sole method of diagnosing familial Mediterranean fever. There&aposs no cure for familial Mediterranean fever. However, treatment can help prevent signs and symptoms. Medications used to control signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever include: - Colchicine. This drug, taken in pill form, reduces inflammation in your body and helps prevent attacks. Work with your doctor to determine the best dosing strategy for you. Some people take one dose a day, while others need smaller, more-frequent doses. Common side effects include bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. - Other drugs to prevent inflammation. For people whose signs and symptoms aren&apost controlled with colchicine, other medications that control inflammation may be options, though these treatments are considered experimental. Other medications include rilonacept (Arcalyst) and anakinra (Kineret).
2.0	Hello i would like more info about Familial Mediterean Fever please as my husband suffers from this. THANKS	What is familial Mediterranean fever?: Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. Prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort. The first episode of illness in familial Mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body&aposs organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.

-1.88888888889	Hello i would like more info about Familial Mediterean Fever please as my husband suffers from this. THANKS	Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (Summary): Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Episodes can begin at any age but most often begin in early childhood. Fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The amount of time between episodes may vary from weeks to years. Episodes usually occur spontaneously, but are sometimes brought on by a variety of triggers (such as injury, infection, or stress). Symptoms during fever episodes may include abdominal, muscle or joint pains; skin rashes (usually on the limbs); puffiness around the eyes; and inflammation in various areas of the body. Some people develop amyloidosis. [1] TRAPS is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [1] [2] Treatment may include systemic corticosteroids at the beginning of an episode to reduce its severity and duration. [2]
2.0	High Blood Pressure. I know you may not answer this but my blood pressure comes up at night when I am asleep. I take four medicines. I have asked doctors why this happens and no one knows. This morning at four A.M. It was 164 and I took a clonidine to help get it done. It worries me so.	High blood pressure (hypertension) (Treatment): Changing your lifestyle can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend you eat a healthy diet with less salt, exercise regularly, quit smoking and maintain a healthy weight. But sometimes lifestyle changes aren&apost enough. In addition to diet and exercise, your doctor may recommend medication to lower your blood pressure. Your blood pressure treatment goal depends on how healthy you are. If you&aposre age 60 or older, and use of medications produces lower systolic blood pressure (such as less than 140 mm Hg), your medications won&apost need to be changed unless they cause negative effects to your health or quality of life. Also, people older than 60 commonly have isolated systolic hypertension - when diastolic pressure is normal but systolic pressure is high. The category of medication your doctor prescribes depends on your blood pressure measurements and your other medical problems. Medications to treat high blood pressure - Thiazide diuretics. Diuretics, sometimes called water pills, are medications that act on your kidneys to help your body eliminate sodium and water, reducing blood volume. Thiazide diuretics are often the first, but not the only, choice in high blood pressure medications. Thiazide diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide), chlorthalidone and others. If you&aposre not taking a diuretic and your blood pressure remains high, talk to your doctor about adding one or replacing a drug you currently take with a diuretic. Diuretics or calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone. A common side effect of diuretics is increased urination. - Beta blockers. These medications reduce the workload on your heart and open your blood vessels, causing your heart to beat slower and with less force. Beta blockers include acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin) and others. When prescribed alone, beta blockers don&apost work as well, especially in black and older people, but may be effective when combined with other blood pressure medications. - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications - such as lisinopril (Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten) and others - help relax blood vessels by blocking the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ACE inhibitor as one of their medications. - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications help relax blood vessels by blocking the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ARB as one of their medications. - Calcium channel blockers. These medications - including amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others - help relax the muscles of your blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. Calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do ACE inhibitors alone. Grapefruit juice interacts with some calcium channel blockers, increasing blood levels of the medication and putting you at higher risk of side effects. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you&aposre concerned about interactions. - Renin inhibitors. Aliskiren (Tekturna) slows down the production of renin, an enzyme produced by your kidneys that starts a chain of chemical steps that increases blood pressure. Tekturna works by reducing the ability of renin to begin this process. Due to a risk of serious complications, including stroke, you shouldn&apost take aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Additional medications sometimes used to treat high blood pressure If you&aposre having trouble reaching your blood pressure goal with combinations of the above medications, your doctor may prescribe: - Alpha blockers. These medications reduce nerve impulses to blood vessels, reducing the effects of natural chemicals that narrow blood vessels. Alpha blockers include doxazosin (Cardura), prazosin (Minipress) and others. - Alpha-beta blockers. In addition to reducing nerve impulses to blood vessels, alpha-beta blockers slow the heartbeat to reduce the amount of blood that must be pumped through the vessels. Alpha-beta blockers include carvedilol (Coreg) and labetalol (Trandate). - Central-acting agents. These medications prevent your brain from signaling your nervous system to increase your heart rate and narrow your blood vessels. Examples include clonidine (Catapres, Kapvay), guanfacine (Intuniv, Tenex) and methyldopa. - Vasodilators. These medications, including hydralazine and minoxidil, work directly on the muscles in the walls of your arteries, preventing the muscles from tightening and your arteries from narrowing. - Aldosterone antagonists. Examples are spironolactone (Aldactone) and eplerenone (Inspra). These drugs block the effect of a natural chemical that can lead to salt and fluid retention, which can contribute to high blood pressure. To reduce the number of daily medication doses you need, your doctor may prescribe a combination of low-dose medications rather than larger doses of one single drug. In fact, two or more blood pressure drugs often are more effective than one. Sometimes finding the most effective medication or combination of drugs is a matter of trial and error. Lifestyle changes to treat high blood pressure No matter what medications your doctor prescribes to treat your high blood pressure, you&aposll need to make lifestyle changes to lower your blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend several lifestyle changes, including: - Eating a healthier diet with less salt (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, diet) - Exercising regularly - Quitting smoking - Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink - Maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you&aposre overweight or obese Resistant hypertension: When your blood pressure is difficult to control If your blood pressure remains stubbornly high despite taking at least three different types of high blood pressure drugs, one of which usually should be a diuretic, you may have resistant hypertension. People who have controlled high blood pressure but are taking four different types of medications at the same time to achieve that control also are considered to have resistant hypertension. The possibility of a secondary cause of the high blood pressure generally should be reconsidered. Having resistant hypertension doesn&apost mean your blood pressure will never get lower. In fact, if you and your doctor can identify what&aposs behind your persistently high blood pressure, there&aposs a good chance you can meet your goal with the help of treatment that&aposs more effective. Your doctor or hypertension specialist can evaluate whether the medications and doses you&aposre taking for your high blood pressure are appropriate. You may have to fine-tune your medications to come up with the most effective combination and doses. Adding an aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone (Aldactone) often leads to control of resistant hypertension. Some experimental therapies such as catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of renal sympathetic nerves (renal denervation) and electrical stimulation of carotid sinus baroreceptors are being studied. In addition, you and your doctor can review medications you&aposre taking for other conditions. Some medications, foods or supplements can worsen high blood pressure or prevent your high blood pressure medications from working effectively. Be open and honest with your doctor about all the medications or supplements you take. If you don&apost take your high blood pressure medications exactly as directed, your blood pressure can pay the price. If you skip doses because you can&apost afford the medications, because you have side effects or because you simply forget to take your medications, talk to your doctor about solutions.

Preeclampsia (Treatment): Preeclampsia often resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery. Most often, at 37 weeks, your baby is developed enough to be healthy outside of the womb. As a result, your provider will likely want your baby to be delivered so the preeclampsia does not get worse. You may get medicines to help trigger labor, or you may need a C-section. If your baby is not fully developed and you have mild preeclampsia, the disease can often be managed at home until your baby has matured. The provider will recommend: Frequent doctor visits to make sure you and your baby are doing well. Medicines to lower your blood pressure (sometimes). The severity of preeclampsia may change quickly, so you&aposll need very careful follow-up. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended. Sometimes, a pregnant woman with preeclampsia is admitted to the hospital. This allows the health care team to watch the baby and mother more closely. Treatment in the hospital may include: Close monitoring of the mother and baby Medicines to control blood pressure and prevent seizures and other complications Steroid injections for pregnancies under 34 weeks gestation to help speed up the development of the baby&aposs lungs You and your provider will continue to discuss the safest time to deliver your baby, considering: How close you are to your due date. The severity of the preeclampsia. Preeclampsia has many severe complications that can harm the mother. How well the baby is doing in the womb. The baby must be delivered if there are signs of severe preeclampsia. These include: Tests that show your baby is not growing well or is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The bottom number of your blood pressure is over 110 mm Hg or is greater than 100 mm Hg consistently over a 24-hour period. Abnormal liver function test results. Severe headaches. Pain in the belly area (abdomen). Seizures or changes in mental function (eclampsia). Fluid buildup in the mother&aposs lungs. HELLP syndrome (rare). Low platelet count or bleeding. Low urine output, a lot of protein in the urine, and other signs that your kidneys are not working properly.

Canker sores are white or yellow and surrounded by a bright red area. They are not cancerous. A canker sore is not the same as a fever blister (cold sore). Canker sores are a common form of mouth ulcer. They may occur with viral infections. In some cases, the cause is unknown. Canker sores may also be linked to problems with the body&aposs immune system. The sores may also be brought on by: - Mouth injury from dental work - Cleaning the teeth too roughly - Biting the tongue or cheek Other things that can trigger canker sores include: - Emotional stress - Lack of certain vitamins and minerals in the diet (especially iron, folic acid, or vitamin B-12) - Hormonal changes - Food allergies Anyone can develop a canker sore. Women are more likely to get them than men. Canker sores may run in families. Canker sores most often appear on the inner surface of the cheeks and lips, tongue, upper surface of the mouth, and the base of the gums. Symptoms include: - One or more painful, red spots or bumps that develops into an open ulcer - White or yellow center - Small size (most often under one third inch or 1 centimeter across) - Gray color as healing starts Less common symptoms include: - Fever - General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise) - Swollen lymph nodes Pain often goes away in 7 to 10 days. It can take 1 to 3 weeks for a canker sore to completely heal. Large ulcers can take longer to heal. Your health care provider can often make the diagnosis by looking at the sore. If canker sores persist or continue to return, tests should be done to look for other causes, such as erythema multiforme, drug allergies, herpes infection, and bullous lichen planus. You may need further testing or a biopsy to look for other causes of mouth ulcers. Canker sores are not cancer and do not cause cancer. There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal. In most cases, the canker sores go away without treatment. Try not to eat hot or spicy foods, which can cause pain. Use over-the-counter medicines that ease pain in the area. - Rinse your mouth with salt water or mild, over-the-counter mouthwashes. (DO NOT use mouthwashes that contain alcohol which can irritate the area more.) - Apply a mixture of half hydrogen peroxide and half water directly to the sore using a cotton swab. Follow by dabbing a small amount of Milk of Magnesia on the canker sore afterward. Repeat these steps 3 to 4 times a day. - Rinse your mouth with a mixture of half Milk of Magnesia and half Benadryl liquid allergy medicine. Swish mixture in the mouth for about 1 minute and then spit out. Medicines prescribed by your provider may be needed for severe cases. These may include: - Chlorhexidine mouthwash - Stronger medicines called corticosteroids that are placed on the sore or are taken in pill form Brush your teeth twice a day and floss your teeth every day. Also, get routine dental check-ups. Canker sores almost always heal on their own. The pain should decrease in a few days. Other symptoms disappear in 10 to 14 days. Call your provider if: - A canker sore or mouth ulcer does not go away after 2 weeks of home care or gets worse. - You get canker sores more than 2 or 3 times a year. - You have symptoms with the canker sore such as fever, diarrhea, headache, or skin rash.

1.88888888889	How to Stop Snoring. How to Stop Snoring	Snoring: Snoring is the hoarse or harsh sound that occurs when air flows past relaxed tissues in your throat, causing the tissues to vibrate as you breathe. Nearly everyone snores now and then, but for some people it can be a chronic problem. Sometimes it may also indicate a serious health condition. In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring. In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. However, these aren&apost suitable or necessary for everyone who snores. Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: - Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep - Excessive daytime sleepiness - Difficulty concentrating - Morning headaches - Sore throat upon awakening - Restless sleep - Gasping or choking at night - High blood pressure - Chest pain at night - Your snoring is so loud it&aposs disrupting your partner&aposs sleep - In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms. These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If your child snores, ask your pediatrician about it. Children can have OSA, too. Nose and throat problems - such as enlarged tonsils - and obesity often can narrow a child&aposs airway, which can lead to your child developing OSA. Snoring can be caused by a number of factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight. When you doze off and progress from a light sleep to a deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue and throat relax. The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate. The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes. This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder. The following conditions can affect the airway and cause snoring: - Your mouth anatomy. Having a low, thick soft palate can narrow your airway. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the back of their throats that may narrow their airways. Likewise, if the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula) is elongated, airflow can be obstructed and vibration increased. - Alcohol consumption. Snoring can also be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction. - Nasal problems. Chronic nasal congestion or a crooked partition between your nostrils (deviated nasal septum) may contribute to your snoring. - Sleep deprivation. Not getting enough sleep can lead to further throat relaxation. - Sleep position. Snoring is typically most frequent and loudest when sleeping on the back as gravity&aposs effect on the throat narrows the airway. Risk factors that may contribute to snoring include: - Being a man. Men are more likely to snore or have sleep apnea than are women. - Being overweight. People who are overweight or obese are more likely to snore or have obstructive sleep apnea. - Having a narrow airway. Some people may have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, which can narrow the airway and cause snoring. - Drinking alcohol. Alcohol relaxes your throat muscles, increasing the risk of snoring. - Having nasal problems. If you have a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, or your nose is chronically congested, your risk of snoring is greater. - Having a family history of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea. Heredity is a potential risk factor for OSA. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, and your medical history. Your doctor will also perform a physical examination. Your doctor may ask your partner some questions about when and how you snore to help assess the severity of the problem. If your child snores, you&aposll be asked about the severity of your child&aposs snoring. Imaging Your doctor may request an imaging test, such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. These tests check the structure of your airway for problems, such as a deviated septum. Sleep study Depending on the severity of your snoring and other symptoms, your doctor may want to conduct a sleep study. Sleep studies may sometimes be done at home. However, depending upon your other medical problems and other sleep symptoms, you may need to stay overnight at a sleep center to undergo an in-depth analysis of your breathing during sleep by a study, called a polysomnography. In a polysomnography, you&aposre connected to many sensors and observed overnight. During the sleep study, the following information is recorded: - Brain waves - Blood oxygen level - Heart rate - Breathing rate - Sleep stages - Eye and leg movements To treat your snoring, your doctor likely will first recommend lifestyle changes, such as: - Losing weight - Avoiding alcohol close to bedtime - Treating nasal congestion - Avoiding sleep deprivation - Avoiding sleeping on your back For snoring accompanied by OSA, your doctor may suggest: - Oral appliances. Oral appliances are form-fitting dental mouthpieces that help advance the position of your jaw, tongue and soft palate to keep your air passage open. If you choose to use an oral appliance, you&aposll work with your dental specialist to optimize the fit and position of the appliance. You&aposll also work with your sleep specialist to make sure the oral appliance is working as intended. Dental visits may be necessary at least once every six months during the first year, and then at least annually after that, to have the fit checked and to assess your oral health. Excessive salivation, dry mouth, jaw pain and facial discomfort are possible side effects from wearing these devices. - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This approach involves wearing a mask over your nose or mouth while you sleep. The mask directs pressurized air from a small bedside pump to your airway to keep it open during sleep. CPAP (SEE-pap) eliminates snoring and is most often used to treating snoring when associated with OSA. Although CPAP is the most reliable and effective method of treating OSA, some people find it uncomfortable or have trouble adjusting to the noise or feel of the machine. - Upper airway surgery. There are a number of procedures that seek to open the upper airway and prevent significant narrowing during sleep through a variety of techniques. For example, in a procedure called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), you&aposre given general anesthetics and your surgeon tightens and trims excess tissues from your throat - a type of face-lift for your throat. Another procedure called maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) involves moving the upper and lower jaws forward, which helps open the airway. Radiofrequency tissue ablation employs a low-intensity radiofrequency signal to shrink tissue in the soft palate, tongue or nose. A newer surgical technique called hypoglossal nerve stimulation employs a stimulus applied to the nerve that controls forward movement of the tongue so the tongue does not block the airway when you take a breath. The effectiveness of these surgeries varies and the response can be challenging to predict. To prevent or quiet snoring, try these tips: - If you&aposre overweight, lose weight. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the throat that contribute to snoring. Losing weight can help reduce snoring. - Sleep on your side. Lying on your back allows your tongue to fall backward into your throat, narrowing your airway and partially obstructing airflow. Try sleeping on your side. If you find that you always end up on your back in the middle of the night, try sewing a tennis ball in the back of your pajama top. - Raise the head of your bed. Raising the head of your bed by about 4 inches may help. - Nasal strips or an external nasal dilator. Adhesive strips applied to the bridge of the nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing. A nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip applied externally across the nostrils that may help decrease airflow resistance so you breathe easier. Nasal strips and external nasal dilators aren&apost effective for people with OSA, however. - Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose. This forces you to breathe through your mouth, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion. To correct a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, you may need surgery. - Limit or avoid alcohol and sedatives. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least two hours before bedtime, and let your doctor know about your snoring before taking sedatives. Sedatives and alcohol depress your central nervous system, causing excessive relaxation of muscles, including the tissues in your throat. - Quit smoking. Smoking cessation may reduce snoring, in addition to having numerous other health benefits. - Get enough sleep. Adults should aim for at least seven hours of sleep per night. The recommended hours of sleep for children vary by age. Preschool-aged children should get 10 to 13 hours a day. School-age children need nine to 12 hours a day, and teens should have eight to 10 hours a day. Because snoring is such a common problem, there are numerous products available, such as nasal sprays or homeopathic therapies. However, most of the products haven&apost been proved effective in clinical trials.

2.0	How to Stop Snoring. How to Stop Snoring	Snoring - adults: Snoring is a loud, hoarse, harsh breathing sound that occurs during sleep. Snoring is common in adults. Loud, frequent snoring can make it hard for both you and your bed partner to get enough sleep. Sometimes snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. When you sleep, the muscles in your throat relax and your tongue slips back in your mouth. Snoring occurs when something blocks air from flowing freely through your mouth and nose. When you breathe, the walls of your throat vibrate, causing the sound of snoring. There are several factors that can lead to snoring, including - Being overweight. The extra tissue in your neck puts pressure on your airways. - Tissue swelling during the last month of pregnancy. - Crooked or bent nasal septum, which is the wall of bone and cartilage between your nostrils. - Growths in your nasal passages (nasal polyps). - Stuffy nose from a cold or allergies. - Swelling in the roof of your mouth (soft palate) or the uvula, the piece of tissue that hangs down in the back of your mouth. These areas may also be longer than normal. - Swollen adenoids and tonsils that block the airways. This is a common cause of snoring in children. - A tongue that is wider at the base, or a larger tongue in a smaller mouth. - Poor muscle tone. This may be caused by aging or by using sleeping pills, antihistamines, or alcohol at bedtime. Sometimes snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. - This occurs when you completely or partly stop breathing for more than 10 seconds while you sleep. - This is followed by a sudden snort or gasp when you start breathing again. During that time you wake up without realizing it. - Then you start to snore again. - This cycle usually happens many times a night, which makes it hard to sleep deeply. Sleep apnea can make it especially hard for your bed partner to get a good night&aposs sleep. To help reduce snoring: - Avoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy at bedtime. - DO NOT sleep flat on your back. Try to sleep on your side instead. You can sew a golf or tennis ball into the back of your night clothes. If you roll over, the pressure of the ball will help remind you to stay on your side. Over time, side sleeping will become a habit. - Lose weight, if you are overweight. - Try over-the-counter, drug-free nasal strips that help widen the nostrils. (These are not treatments for sleep apnea.) If your health care provider has given you a breathing device, use it on a regular basis. Follow your provider&aposs advice for treating allergy symptoms. Talk to your health care provider if you: - Have problems with attention, concentration, or memory - Wake up in the morning not feeling rested - Feel very drowsy during the day - Have morning headaches - Gain weight - Tried self-care for snoring, and it has not helped You should also talk with your provider if you have episodes of no breathing (apnea) during the night. Your partner can tell you if you are snoring loudly or making choking and gasping sounds. Depending on your symptoms and the cause of your snoring, your provider may refer you to a sleep specialist.

Raising the head of your bed by about 4 inches may help. - Nasal strips or an external nasal dilator. Adhesive strips applied to the bridge of the nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing. A nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip applied externally across the nostrils that may help decrease airflow resistance so you breathe easier. Nasal strips and external nasal dilators aren&apost effective for people with OSA, however. - Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose. This forces you to breathe through your mouth, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion. To correct a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, you may need surgery. - Limit or avoid alcohol and sedatives. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least two hours before bedtime, and let your doctor know about your snoring before taking sedatives. Sedatives and alcohol depress your central nervous system, causing excessive relaxation of muscles, including the tissues in your throat. - Quit smoking. Smoking cessation may reduce snoring, in addition to having numerous other health benefits. - Get enough sleep. Adults should aim for at least seven hours of sleep per night. The recommended hours of sleep for children vary by age. Preschool-aged children should get 10 to 13 hours a day. School-age children need nine to 12 hours a day, and teens should have eight to 10 hours a day.
1.83333333333	I have exercise induced asthma. Would any of these non drug devises be suitable please?	Exercise-induced asthma: Exercised-induced asthma is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by strenuous exercise. It causes shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and other symptoms during or after exercise. The preferred term for this condition is exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (brong-koh-kun-STRIK-shun). This term is more accurate because the exercise induces narrowing of airways (bronchoconstriction) but is not the root cause of asthma. Among people with asthma, exercise is likely just one of several factors that can induce breathing difficulties. For most people with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, treatment with common asthma medications and preventive measures enable them to exercise and remain active. Signs and symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may begin during or a few minutes after exercise, and they may persist for 30 minutes or longer if left untreated. The signs and symptoms may include: - Coughing - Wheezing - Shortness of breath - Chest tightness or pain - Fatigue during exercise - Poorer than expected athletic performance - Feeling out of shape even when you&aposre in good physical shape - Avoidance of activity (a sign primarily among young children) When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Because a number of conditions can cause similar symptoms, it&aposs important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Get emergency medical treatment if you have worsening symptoms: - Shortness of breath or wheezing that is quickly getting worse - No improvement even after using a prescription inhaler for asthma attacks Medical researchers are exploring several ideas regarding the cause of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. There may be more than one biological process that can lead to the condition. Researchers do know that in people who experience exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, strenuous exercise sets in motion molecular events that result in inflammation and the production of mucus in the airways. Factors that may increase the risk of the condition or act as triggers include: - Cold air - Dry air - Air pollution - High pollen counts - Chlorine in swimming pools - Chemicals used with ice rink resurfacing equipment - Respiratory infections or other lung disease - Activities with extended periods of deep breathing, such as long-distance running, swimming or soccer In addition to asking questions about your symptoms, your doctor will conduct a medical exam. He or she will also order tests to assess your lung function and rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Test of normal lung function Your doctor will likely administer a spirometry (spy-ROM-uh-tree) test to assess how well your lungs function when you aren&apost exercising. A spirometer measures how much air you inhale, how much you exhale and how quickly you exhale. After you do the test, your doctor may give you an inhaled medication to open your lungs (bronchodilator). You&aposll repeat the test, and your doctor will compare the results of the two measurements to see whether the bronchodilator improved your airflow. This initial lung function test is important for ruling out underlying chronic asthma as the cause of symptoms. Exercise challenge tests An additional test that enables your doctor to observe and assess symptoms is an exercise challenge. You will run on a treadmill or use other stationary exercise equipment that increases your breathing rate. This exercise needs to be intense enough to trigger the symptoms you&aposve experienced. If needed, you might be asked to perform a real-life exercise challenge, such as climbing stairs. Spirometry tests before and after the challenge can provide evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Alternate challenge tests As an alternative to the exercise challenge, your doctor may use an inhalation test that simulates the conditions that would likely trigger exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. If your airways respond to these stimuli, then the test should produce virtually the same lung function you have when exercising. Again spirometry tests before and after the challenge test provide information about changes in lung function. These challenge tests include the following: - Methacholine challenge, the use of an inhaled agent that interacts with certain smooth muscle cells in airways and results in bronchoconstriction - Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) challenge, inhaling a mixture of dry air composed of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen that simulates the exchange of air when breathing is difficult - Mannitol challenge, inhaling a dry powder that can trigger water loss on the surface of the airways and switch on molecular activity that controls inflammation - conditions that cause bronchoconstriction in people with oversensitive airways Ruling out other conditions Your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other conditions with symptoms similar to those of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. These conditions include: - Vocal cord dysfunction - Allergies - Lung disease - Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) or other heart conditions - Gastroesophageal reflux disease Your doctor may prescribe drugs to take shortly before exercise or to take daily for long-term control. Pre-exercise medications Your doctor may prescribe a drug that you take before exercise to minimize or prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Talk to your doctor about how much time you need between taking the drug and exercising. Drugs in this group include the following: - Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) are inhaled drugs that help open airways. These are the most commonly used and generally most effective pre-exercise medications. Daily use of a SABA is not recommended, however, because you may develop a tolerance to its effect. These drugs include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA) and pirbuterol (Maxair). - Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) is an inhaled medication that relaxes the airways and may be effective for some people. A generic version of ipratropium also can be taken with a nebulizer. Long-term control medications Your doctor may prescribe a long-term control drug in addition to daily use of a pre-exercise medication, to manage underlying chronic asthma or to manage symptoms when pre-exercise treatment alone isn&apost effective. These medications, usually taken daily, include the following: - Inhaled corticosteroids help suppress inflammation in your airways. You may need to take the drug two to four weeks before they will have maximum benefit. These medications include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler) and beclomethasone (Qvar). - Combination inhalers contain a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), a drug that relaxes airways. While these inhalers are prescribed for long-term control, your doctor may recommend use prior to exercise. Combination inhalers include fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus), budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort), and mometasone and formoterol (Dulera). - Leukotriene modifiers are oral medications that may block inflammatory activity for some people. These drugs may be used daily or as a preventive treatment before exercise if taken at least two hours in advance. Examples include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo, Zyflo CR). Potential side effects of leukotriene modifiers include behavior and mood changes and suicidal thoughts. Talk to your doctor if you experience these signs or symptoms. Don&apost rely only on quick-relief medications You can also use pre-exercise drugs as a quick-relief treatment for symptoms. However, you shouldn&apost need to use your pre-exercise inhaler more often than your doctor recommends. Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week, how often you use your pre-exercise inhaler for prevention and how often you use it to treat symptoms. If you use it daily or you frequently use it for symptom relief, your doctor may adjust your long-term control medication. Steps you can take to prevent or minimize symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction include the following: - Do a 10-minute warm-up that varies in intensity before you begin regular exercise. - Breathe through your nose to warm and humidify the air before it enters your lungs. - Wear a face mask or scarf when exercising, especially in cold, dry weather. - If you have allergies, avoid triggers. For example, don&apost exercise outside when pollen counts are high. - Avoid strenuous exercise if you have a cold or other respiratory infection. - Exercise regularly to stay in shape and promote good respiratory health. At school Talk to your doctor about writing an action plan if your child experiences exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. This document provides step-by-step instructions for teachers, nurses and coaches that explain what treatments your child needs, when treatments should be administered and what to do if your child experiences symptoms. There is limited clinical evidence of alternative therapies that may modify the severity of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or provide additional benefit to standard treatments. Possible beneficial interventions include: - A low-salt diet - Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, or fish oil supplements - Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C (strawberries, oranges, broccoli, leafy vegetables and others) or vitamin C supplements

Exercise-induced asthma (Be Careful Where and When you Exercise): Having asthma symptoms when you exercise does not mean you cannot or should not exercise. But be aware of your EIA triggers. Cold or dry air may trigger your asthma symptoms. If you do exercise in cold or dry air: - Breathe through your nose. - Wear a scarf or mask over your mouth. DO NOT exercise when the air is polluted. DO NOT exercise near fields or lawns that have just been mowed. Warm up before you exercise, and cool down afterward: - To warm up, walk or do your exercise activity slowly before you speed up. - The longer you warm up, the better. - To cool down, walk or do your exercise activity slowly for several minutes. Some kinds of exercise may be less likely to trigger asthma symptoms than others. - Swimming is a good sport for people with EIA. The warm, moist air helps keep asthma symptoms away. - Football, baseball, and other sports with periods when you do not move fast are less likely to trigger your asthma symptoms. Activities that keep you moving fast all the time are more likely to trigger asthma symptoms, such as running, basketball, or soccer.

Burning mouth syndrome (Diagnosis): There&aposs no one test that can determine if you have burning mouth syndrome. Instead, your doctor or dentist will try to rule out other problems before diagnosing burning mouth syndrome. Your doctor or dentist will review your medical history and medications, examine your mouth, and ask you to describe your symptoms, oral habits and oral care routine. In addition, your doctor will likely perform a general medical exam, looking for signs of other conditions. You may have some of the following tests: - Blood tests. Blood tests can check your complete blood count, glucose level, thyroid function, nutritional factors and immune functioning, all of which may provide clues about the source of your mouth discomfort. - Oral cultures or biopsies. Taking and analyzing samples from your mouth can determine whether you have a fungal, bacterial or viral infection. - Allergy tests. Your doctor may suggest allergy testing to see if you may be allergic to certain foods, additives or even substances in dentures. - Salivary measurements. With burning mouth syndrome, you may feel that you have a dry mouth. Salivary tests can confirm whether you have a reduced salivary flow. - Gastric reflux tests. These tests can determine if you have GERD. - Imaging. Your doctor may recommend an MRI, CT scan or other imaging tests to check for other health problems. - Temporarily stopping medication. If you take medications that may contribute to mouth discomfort, your doctor may suggest temporarily stopping them, if possible, to see if your discomfort goes away. Don&apost try this on your own, because it can be dangerous to stop some medications. - Psychological questionnaires. You may be asked to fill out questionnaires that can help determine if you have symptoms of depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions.

Chemotherapy (Chemotherapy, Cancer chemotherapy , Cancer drug therapy , Cytotoxic chemotherapy): The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: Cure the cancer Shrink the cancer Prevent the cancer from spreading Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: Injections or shots into the muscles Injections or shots under the skin Into an artery Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) Pills taken by mouth Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: Central venous catheter Central venous catheter with a port Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: Are more likely to have infections Become tired more easily Bleed too much, even during everyday activities Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth Have a poor appetite or lose weight Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea Lose their hair Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs Eating and drinking safely Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Richard LoCicero, MD, private practice specializing in hematology and medical oncology, Longstreet Cancer Center, Gainesville, GA.

Radiation therapy (Radiation therapy, Radiotherapy , Cancer - radiation therapy , Radiation therapy - radioactive seeds , Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) , Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) , Radiosurgery-radiation therapy , Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)-radiation therapy , Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)-radiation therapy , Intraoperative radiotherapy , Proton radiotherapy-radiation therapy): Radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death. Radiation therapy is used to fight many types of cancer. Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed. It may also be used in combination with other therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy to: Shrink a tumor as much as possible before surgery Help prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery or chemotherapy Relieve symptoms caused by a tumor, such as pain, pressure, or bleeding Treat cancers that cannot be removed with surgery TYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY Different types of radiation therapy include external, internal, and intraoperative. EXTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY External radiation is the most common form. This method carefully aims high-powered x-rays or particles directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Newer methods provide more effective treatment with less tissue damage. These include: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) Stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) Proton therapy is another kind of radiation used to treat cancer. Rather than using x-rays to destroy cancer cells, proton therapy uses a beam of special particles called protons. Because it causes less damage to healthy tissue, proton therapy is often used for cancers that are very close to critical parts of the body. It is only used for certain types of cancer. INTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY Internal beam radiation is placed inside your body. One method uses radioactive seeds that are placed directly into or near the tumor. This method is called brachytherapy, and is used to treat prostate cancer. It is used less often to treat breast, cervical, lung, and other cancers. Another method involves receiving radiation by drinking it, swallowing a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. Thyroid cancer may be treated this way. INTRAOPERTIVE RADIATION THERAPY (IORT) This type of radiation is usually used during surgery to remove a tumor. Right after the tumor is removed and before the surgeon closes the incision, radiation is delivered to the site where the tumor used to be. IORT is generally used for tumors that have not spread and microscopic tumor cells may remain after the larger tumor is removed. Compared with external radiation, advantages of IORT may include: Only the tumor area is targeted so there is less harm to healthy tissue Only a single dose of radiation is given Delivers a smaller dose of radiation SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation, and how often you have the therapy. External beam radiation may cause skin changes, such as hair loss, red or burning skin, thinning of skin tissue, or even shedding of the outer layer of skin.

We&aposre suffering terribly and were from all over the world. What would the treatment be?	Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body&aposs immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider&aposs supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia, or fibromyalgia syndrome, is a condition that causes aches and pain all over the body. People with fibromyalgia often experience other symptoms, such as extreme tiredness or sleeping, mood, or memory problems. Fibromyalgia affects more women than men. The pain, extreme tiredness, and lack of sleep that fibromyalgia causes can affect your ability to work or do daily activities. Treatment can help relieve pain and help prevent flare-ups of symptoms. Fibromyalgia is also called fibromyalgia syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that happen together. People with fibromyalgia experience aches and pain all over the body, fatigue (extreme tiredness that does not get better with sleep or rest), and problems sleeping. Fibromyalgia may be caused by a problem in the brain with nerves and pain signals. In other words, in people with fibromyalgia, the brain misunderstands everyday pain and other sensory experiences, making the person more sensitive to pressure, temperature (hot or cold), bright lights, and noise compared to people who do not have fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia has been compared to arthritis. Like arthritis, fibromyalgia causes pain and fatigue. But, unlike arthritis, fibromyalgia does not cause redness and swelling, or damage to your joints. Fibromyalgia affects as many as 4 million Americans 18 and older.1 The average age range at which fibromyalgia is diagnosed is 35 to 45 years old, but most people have had symptoms, including chronic pain, that started much earlier in life. Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men.1,2 Maybe. Fibromyalgia is more common in people who:1 Chronic (long-term), widespread pain is the most common symptom of fibromyalgia. You may feel the pain all over your body. Or, you may feel it more in the muscles you use most often, like in your back or legs. The pain may feel like a deep muscle ache, or it may throb or burn. Your pain may also be worse in the morning. Other symptoms of fibromyalgia include:3,4,5 Women with fibromyalgia often have more morning fatigue, pain all over the body, and IBS symptoms than men with fibromyalgia have.8 Fibromyalgia symptoms can happen without warning. But certain events may trigger flare-ups, including: Researchers are not sure exactly what causes fibromyalgia. Genetics may play a role. Studies also show that the brains of people with fibromyalgia may not process pain in the same way as people who do not have fibromyalgia. Lower levels of certain brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin or norepinephrine, may cause you to be more sensitive to pain and have a more severe reaction to pain. Imaging studies of the brain show that people with fibromyalgia feel pain when people without fibromyalgia do not.10 Some medicines prescribed to treat fibromyalgia try to bring the levels of those neurotransmitters back into balance. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and your medical history. There is no lab test for fibromyalgia. Instead, your doctor will make a diagnosis based upon two criteria: You may have to see several doctors before getting a diagnosis. One reason for this may be that pain and fatigue, the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, also are symptoms of many other conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Doctors try to figure out if fibromyalgia or another health problem is causing your symptoms. Treatment for fibromyalgia may include: Your doctor or nurse may also suggest taking steps at home to relieve your symptoms. You can take the following steps at home to help relieve your symptoms: Maybe. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease that is often a lifelong condition. But fibromyalgia is not a progressive disease, meaning it will not get worse over time. It also does not cause damage to your joints, muscles, or organs. Taking steps to treat fibromyalgia can help relieve your symptoms. Many women with fibromyalgia have no problems getting pregnant, and some women report that their symptoms get better during pregnancy. But, for some women, fibromyalgia can cause problems during pregnancy. Your symptoms may flare or get worse, especially in the first few months of pregnancy. Also, some normal pregnancy complaints, such as fatigue, stress, and mood swings caused by changing hormones, may be worse for women with fibromyalgia. Talk to your doctor about any medicines you take to treat fibromyalgia, as they may cause other health problems for you or your unborn baby. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia are similar in many ways. A person can have fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. Both ME/CFS and fibromyalgia have pain and fatigue as symptoms. But the main symptom of fibromyalgia is pain, and the main symptom of ME/CFS is extreme tiredness that does not get better with sleep and rest, also called fatigue. Usually. Most people with fibromyalgia continue to work, but you may have to make changes to do so. You can cut down the number of hours you work, switch to a less demanding job, or adapt a current job. If you face challenges at work, an occupational therapist can help you design a more comfortable workstation or find more efficient and less painful ways to do your job. A number of federal laws protect your rights. However, if you cannot work because of your fibromyalgia, you may qualify for disability benefits through your employer or the Social Security Administration.

-1.5	I want more information on Hypertension and fibromyalgia, I seem to be getting only topics on diabetes and I do not have this. I enjoy reading the current info.	Do you have information about Diabetes Medicines: Summary : Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. If you can&apost control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity, you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, your schedule, and your other health conditions. With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, can start when the body doesn&apost use insulin as it should. If your body can&apost keep up with the need for insulin, you may need to take pills. Along with meal planning and physical activity, diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Fibromyalgia (Causes): Doctors don&apost know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain&aposs pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals.

There are many things you can do to while living with fibromyalgia, including: - Getting enough sleep. - Exercising. - Adjusting your work demands. - Eating well. Getting Enough Sleep Getting enough sleep and the right kind of sleep can help ease the pain and fatigue of fibromyalgia. You may have problems such as pain, restless legs syndrome, or brainwave changes that interfere with restful sleep. It is important to discuss any sleep problems with your doctor, who can prescribe or recommend treatment. Tips for Good Sleep - Keep regular sleep habits. Try to get to bed and wake up at the same time every day. - Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the late afternoon and evening. Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy, drinking any close to bedtime can disturb your sleep. - Time your exercise. Regular daytime exercise can help improve your nighttime sleep. However, exercise within 3 hours of bedtime can keep you awake. - Avoid daytime naps. Sleeping in the afternoon can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you feel like you cannot get by without a nap, set an alarm for 1 hour. When it goes off, get up and start moving. - Reserve your bed for sleeping. Watching TV, reading, or using a laptop or phone in bed can keep you awake. - Keep your bedroom comfortable. Try to keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. - Avoid drinking liquids and eating spicy meals before bed. Heartburn and late-night trips to the bathroom can interfere with your sleep. - Wind down before bed. Avoid working right up to bedtime. Try some relaxing activities that get you ready for sleep, such as listening to soft music or taking a warm bath. Exercising Although pain and fatigue may make exercise and daily activities difficult, it is important for you to be as physically active as possible. Research shows that regular exercise is one of the most useful treatments for fibromyalgia. If you have too much pain or fatigue to do exercise, you should begin with walking or other gentle exercise. Over time you can build your strength. Adjusting Your Work Life You can continue to work when you have fibromyalgia, but may have to make some changes to do so. For example, you may need to cut down the number of hours they work, switch to a less demanding job, or adapt your current job. An occupational therapist can help you make changes at work. For example, they can help design a more comfortable workstation or find more efficient and less painful ways to lift. Eating well Although some people with fibromyalgia report feeling better when they eat or avoid certain foods, no specific diet has been proven to influence fibromyalgia. Of course, it is important to have a healthy, balanced diet. Not only will proper nutrition give you more energy and make you generally feel better, it will also help you avoid other health problems.

Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as "fibro fog" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don&apost know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain&aposs pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person&aposs body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don&apost require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren&apost new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven&apost been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body&aposs muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body&aposs natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.

The yellow color comes from bilirubin, a byproduct of old red blood cells. Jaundice is a sign of other diseases. This article discusses the possible causes of jaundice in children and adults. Newborn jaundice occurs in very young infants.
-0.454545454545	Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?	What are Jaundice causes?: Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body. This may happen when: - There are too many red blood cells dying or breaking down and going to the liver. - The liver is overloaded or damaged. - The bilirubin from the liver is unable to properly move into the digestive tract. Conditions that can cause jaundice include: - Infections of the liver from a virus (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E) or a parasite - Use of certain drugs (such as an overdose of acetaminophen) or exposure to poisons - Birth defects or disorders present since birth that makes it hard for the body to breakdown bilirubin (such as Gilbert syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar syndrome) - Liver damage - Gallstones or gallbladder disorders - Blood disorders - Cancer of the pancreas - Bile build-up in the gallbladder because of pressure in the belly area during pregnancy (jaundice of pregnancy)

2.0	Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?	Jaundice and breastfeeding (Causes): Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced as the body recycles old red blood cells. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool. It can be normal for newborn babies to be a little yellow between days 1 and 5 of life. The color most often peaks around day 3 or 4. Breast milk jaundice is seen after the first week of life. It is likely caused by: - Factors in a mother&aposs milk that help a baby absorb bilirubin from the intestine - Factors that keep certain proteins in the baby&aposs liver from breaking down bilirubin Sometimes, jaundice occurs when your baby does not get enough breast milk, instead of from the breast milk itself. This kind of jaundice is different because it starts in the first few days of life. It is called "breastfeeding failure jaundice," "breast-non-feeding jaundice," or even "starvation jaundice." - Babies who are born early (before 37 or 38 weeks) are not always able to feed well. - Breastfeeding failure or breast-non-feeding jaundice may also occur when feedings are scheduled by the clock (such as, every 3 hours for 10 minutes) or when babies who show signs of hunger are given pacifiers. Breast milk jaundice may run in families. It occurs just as often in males and females and affects about a third of all newborns who get only their mother&aposs milk.
0.727272727273	Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?	Newborn jaundice (When to Contact a Medical Professional): All babies should be seen by a provider in the first 5 days of life to check for jaundice: - Infants who spend less than 24 hours in a hospital should be seen by age 72 hours. - Infants who are sent home between 24 and 48 hours should be seen again by age 96 hours. - Infants who are sent home between 48 and 72 hours should be seen again by age 120 hours. Jaundice is an emergency if the baby has a fever, has become listless, or is not feeding well. Jaundice may be dangerous in high-risk newborns. Jaundice is generally NOT dangerous in babies who were born full term and who do not have other medical problems. Call the infant&aposs provider if: - Jaundice is severe (the skin is bright yellow) - Jaundice continues to increase after the newborn visit, lasts longer than 2 weeks, or other symptoms develop - The feet, especially the soles, are yellow Talk with your baby&aposs provider if you have questions.

Biliary atresia (Causes): Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not develop normally. The reason why this happens is unknown. The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat. In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.
-1.63636363636	Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?	Dubin-Johnson syndrome (Cause): DJS is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCC2 gene . The ABCC2 gene codes for a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2). MRP2 transports substances out of cells . It is primarily found in the liver, but can also be found in the kidneys, intestine, and placenta during pregnancy. [4] Mutations in the ABCC2 gene affect the structure and function of the MRP2 protein. This may disrupt the body&aposs ability to rid itself of bilirubin, resulting in a build up. [4]

You may get infected if you come in contact with an infected animal. The infection occurs in warmer climates. Leptospirosis is not spread from person to person, except in very rare cases. Risk factors include: Occupational exposure -- farmers, ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, veterinarians, loggers, sewer workers, rice field workers, and military personnel Recreational activities -- fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, and trail biking in warm areas Household exposure -- pet dogs, domesticated livestock, rainwater catchment systems, and infected rodents Weil disease is rare in the continental United States. Hawaii has the highest number of cases in the United States.
-1.81818181818	Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?	Gilbert syndrome (Causes): Changes in the UGT1A1 gene cause Gilbert syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body. The bilirubin-UGT enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. During this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. Glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body. Gilbert syndrome occurs worldwide, but some mutations occur more often in particular populations. In many populations, the most common genetic change that causes Gilbert syndrome (known as UGT1A1*28) occurs in an area near the UGT1A1 gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of the bilirubin-UGT enzyme. This genetic change impairs enzyme production. However, this change is uncommon in Asian populations, and affected Asians often have a mutation that changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the bilirubin-UGT enzyme. This type of mutation, known as a missense mutation, results in reduced enzyme function. People with Gilbert syndrome have approximately 30 percent of normal bilirubin-UGT enzyme function. As a result, unconjugated bilirubin is not glucuronidated quickly enough. This toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing mild hyperbilirubinemia. Not everyone with the genetic changes that cause Gilbert syndrome develops hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that additional factors, such as conditions that further hinder the glucuronidation process, may be necessary for development of the condition. For example, red blood cells may break down too easily, releasing excess amounts of bilirubin that the impaired enzyme cannot keep up with. Alternatively, movement of bilirubin into the liver, where it would be glucuronidated, may be impaired. These other factors may be due to changes in other genes.

PL. ADD MY E-MAIL ID	Lung cancer (Exams and Tests): Lung cancer is often found when an x-ray or CT scan is done for another reason. If lung cancer is suspected, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked if you smoke. If so, you&aposll be asked how much you smoke and for how long you have smoked. You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk of lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may hear fluid around the lungs. This may suggest cancer. Tests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or see if it has spread include: - Bone scan - Chest x-ray - Complete blood count (CBC) - CT scan of the chest - MRI of the chest - Positron emission tomography (PET) scan - Sputum test to look for cancer cells - Thoracentesis (sampling of fluid buildup around the lung) In most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do this: - Bronchoscopy combined with biopsy - CT-scan-directed needle biopsy - Endoscopic esophageal ultrasound (EUS) with biopsy - Mediastinoscopy with biopsy - Open lung biopsy - Pleural biopsy If the biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up and gives you an idea of what to expect.

PL. ADD MY E-MAIL ID	Working during cancer treatment (Working during cancer treatment, Chemotherapy - working , Radiation - working): Many people continue to work throughout their cancer treatment. Cancer, or the side effects of treatment, may make it hard to work on some days. Understanding how treatment may affect you at work can help you and your coworkers know what to expect. Then you can plan ahead so that you can keep working with as little interruption as possible. If you feel well enough, you may find that the daily routine of a job helps you maintain a sense of balance. But having unrealistic goals could cause extra stress. If possible, prepare yourself for the ways cancer could affect you at work. You may need to take time off for treatments. You may get tired more easily. At times, you could be distracted by pain or stress. You could have trouble remembering some things. There are ways you can plan ahead to make working through cancer easier on you and your co-workers. Schedule treatments late in the day so you can go home afterwards. Try to schedule chemotherapy at the end of the week so you have the weekend to recover. Talk to your manager about working at home some days, if possible. You can spend less time commuting and rest when you need to. Let your boss know your treatment schedule and when you will be out of work. Ask your family and friends to help around the house. This will leave you with more energy for work. Consider letting your co-workers know you have cancer. It might be easier to work if you do not have to make excuses for taking time off. Some co-workers may offer to help out if you have to be out of the office. Consider talking first to one or two people you trust. They might have ideas of how to share the news with your other coworkers. Decide in advance how much information you want to share. The right amount will depend on you and your work culture. Be matter of fact when you share the news. Share the basic facts: that you have cancer, are getting treatment, and plan to keep working. Some people may have an emotional reaction to the news. Your job is to take care of yourself. You do not have to help every person you know deal with their feelings about cancer. Some co-workers may say things that are not helpful. They may want to talk about cancer when you want to work. They may ask for details that you do not want to share. Some people might try to give you advice about your treatment. Be ready with responses like: "I would rather not discuss that at work." "I need to focus on this project right now." "That is a private decision I will make with my doctor." Some people find that working through treatment is too difficult. Taking time off from work might be the best thing you can do for your health and your job. If your work performance is suffering, taking time off will allow your employer to bring in temporary help. Your right to return to work after treatment is protected under federal law. You cannot be fired for being sick. Depending on how long you need to be out of work, short-term or long-term disability may cover some of your salary while you are not working. Even if you plan to work through treatment, it is a good idea to find out if your employer has disability insurance. You can get an application for both short and long-term disability in case you need to apply later. Talk to your health care provider about how you feel at work, and if you should consider taking time off. If you do, your provider can help you fill out an application for disability coverage.

ADD MY E-MAIL ID	Microscopic polyangiitis (Microscopic polyangiitis,): Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation ( vasculitis), which can lead to organ damage. [1] The kidneys, lungs, nerves, skin, and joints are the most commonly affected areas of the body. MPA is diagnosed in people of all ages, all ethnicities, and both genders. [2] The cause of this disorder is unknown. The symptoms of MPA depend on which blood vessels are involved and what organs in the body are affected. The most common symptoms of MPA include kidney inflammation, weight loss, skin lesions, nerve damage, and fevers. [2] Other symptoms depending on the area(s) of the body affected may include: [3] Skin-Rash Lungs-cough, breathing problems, spitting up blood Gastrointestinal-bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, abdominal pain Brain/neurological-tingling, pain, weakness, loss of sensation, seizures Musculoskeletal-joint pain, muscle pain This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have.

It is not contagious, does not usually run in families, and is not a form of cancer . The immune system is thought to play a critical role in the development of MPA. It is thought that the immune system becomes overactive and causes blood vessel and tissue inflammation, which leads to organ damage. It is not known what causes the immune system to become overactive. [1] The treatment of MPA is dependent on the extent of the disease, rate of progression, and the degree of inflammation. The goal of treatment is to stop organ damage that occurs as a result of MPA and involves use of medications that suppress the immune system . Treatment is typically carried out in three phases: [1] [2] [3] Remission induction using prednisone and cyclophosphamide. This phase usually lasts between 4 and 6 months. Remission maintenance using prednisone and replacing cyclophosphamide with other medications such as methotrexate and azathioprine. This phases usually lasts between 12 and 24 months. Treatment of relapse utilizing medications from phase one or other therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin for resistant cases. FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition. Learn more orphan products. National Library of Medicine Drug Information Portal Medline Plus Health Information The prognosis for MPA depends on the severity of the condition. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment lead to a better overall prognosis. [1] With treatment, 75 percent of individuals achieve complete remission . [3] After achieving remission, it is possible for MPA to recur (often referred to as a "relapse"). Relapses occur in about 30-50% of people with MPA. Achieving remission is again possible for most people with MPA. [1] [3] If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease.

PL. ADD MY E-MAIL ID	Yellow nail syndrome (Yellow nail syndrome, Lymphedema with yellow nails , YNS): Yellow nail syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by three features: yellow nail discoloration, respiratory problems, and lower limb swelling ( lymphedema). It usually occurs in people over age 50, but can occur in younger people. [1] In addition to being yellow, nails may lack a cuticle, grow very slowly, and become detached ( onycholysis). [2] Respiratory problems may include chronic cough, bronchiectasis, and pleural effusion. [1] Chronic sinusitis may also occur. [1] The cause of yellow nail syndrome remains unknown. It usually occurs on its own, but is sometimes associated with autoimmune disease , lymphatic diseases, or cancers . Some researchers have hypothesized that titanium may play a role in the development of yellow nail syndrome (for example, in dental or joint implants or other environmental exposures). Treatment addresses each symptom present. In some cases, yellow nail syndrome goes away on its own. [1] This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed.

Lymphatic impairment or reduced lymphatic drainage has been proposed, as it may explain lymphedema, pleural effusion, and nail discoloration. However, problems with the lymphatic system are not known to cause bronchiectasia and sinusitis. Additionally, lymphatic impairment is not easy to confirm. [1] While most cases of yellow nail syndrome occur randomly, a few cases have run in families. Although this suggests that genetic factors may play a role in some cases, no known genetic factors have been identified. [2] Rarely, yellow nail syndrome has occurred in people with autoimmune disease , lymphatic diseases, or cancers . Some researchers have hypothesized that titanium exposure may play a role in the development of yellow nail syndrome in some people (for example, in dental or joint implants; drugs that contain titanium dioxide; candy or gum; or other environmental exposures). [1] [3] [4] However, a direct association between titanium exposure and yellow nail syndrome has not been confirmed. [4] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person&aposs medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Yellow nail syndrome management aims to address each of the symptoms. Treatment for nail discoloration may include oral vitamin E and/or triazole antifungals. Pleural effusion may be treated with surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be prescribed for bronchiectasia with chronic mucus production. Lymphedema treatment may involve low-stretch bandages and elastic compression garments combined with skin care, exercises and manual lymph drainage as needed. [1] In some cases, yellow nail syndrome goes away on its own or when an underlying, associated condition is treated.

It usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the mouth, but tumors can also develop in other parts of the body (including the lymph nodes , lungs, or digestive tract). The abnormal cells of Kaposi sarcoma cause purplish, reddish blue, or dark brown/black skin lesions ( macules, nodules, plaques) on the legs and the face. These lesions may look bad, but they usually cause no symptoms. However, when the lesions are in the lungs, liver, or digestive tract, they may cause serious problems like gastrointestinal bleeding or trouble breathing. [1] Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with a virus called the Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). [2] Kaposi sarcoma is classified into four types based upon the different populations in which it develops: classic (which presents in middle or old age), endemic (described in sub-Saharan indigenous Africans), iatrogenic (associated with immunosuppressive drug therapy) and AIDS-associated (epidemic KS). [3] Options for treatment may include local therapy , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and biologic therapy ( immunotherapy ). The main aim is to restore immunity.

2.0	lupus. Hi, I want to know about Lupus and its treatment. Best, NAME	Lupus: Lupus is an autoimmune disease  that can affect almost every organ in the body. Symptoms of lupus can range from very mild to life-threatening. There are three main types of lupus; systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus, and drug-induced lupus. [1] Symptoms may include pain or swelling in joints, muscle pain, fever, red rashes, most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash"), hair loss, chest pain, sensitivity to the sun, swelling in legs or around the eyes, and feeling tired. [2] Genetics is thought to play a role in the development of lupus along with other lifestyle and environmental factors . Studies suggest that a number of different genes may be involved in determining a person’s likelihood of developing the disease, which tissues and organs are affected, and the severity of disease. Lupus is more common in young women. The treatment of lupus depends on the severity of the condition and what parts of the body are affected. Treatment may include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, antimalarial drugs, anti-inflammatory steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and other such as BLyS-specific inhibitors ( Belimumab). [1] You can read about the signs and symptoms of lupus from  MedlinePlus and the  National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Antinuclear antibody positivity - Antiphospholipid antibody positivity - Arthritis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cutaneous photosensitivity - Hemolytic anemia - Leukopenia - Nephritis - Pericarditis - Pleuritis - Psychosis - Seizures - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Thrombocytopenia - View complete list of signs and symptoms... The Lupus Foundation of American has a page called  Is lupus hereditary? that provides a good overview. They also have a Genetics page for all of their content tagged as related to genetics. Medscape Reference has an in-depth review of the genetics of lupus that was written for healthcare professionals but can be useful to anyone looking for detailed information.

0.571428571429	lupus. Hi, I want to know about Lupus and its treatment. Best, NAME	Lupus: Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when your body&aposs immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus - a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks - occurs in many but not all cases of lupus. Some people are born with a tendency toward developing lupus, which may be triggered by infections, certain drugs or even sunlight. While there&aposs no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike. Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent. Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes - called flares - when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - Joint pain, stiffness and swelling - Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body - Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity) - Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud&aposs phenomenon) - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Dry eyes - Headaches, confusion and memory loss When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop an unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching or fatigue. Lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body (autoimmune disease). It&aposs likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment. It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include: - Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people. - Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people. - Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped. Factors that may increase your risk of lupus include: - Your sex. Lupus is more common in women. - Age. Although lupus affects people of all ages, it&aposs most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45. - Race. Lupus is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. Diagnosing lupus is difficult because signs and symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Signs and symptoms of lupus may vary over time and overlap with those of many other disorders. No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis. Laboratory tests Blood and urine tests may include: - Complete blood count. This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn&apost specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer. - Kidney and liver assessment. Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs. - Urinalysis. An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys. - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing. Imaging tests If your doctor suspects that lupus is affecting your lungs or heart, he or she may suggest: - Chest X-ray. An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart. Biopsy Lupus can harm your kidneys in many different ways, and treatments can vary, depending on the type of damage that occurs. In some cases, it&aposs necessary to test a small sample of kidney tissue to determine what the best treatment might be. The sample can be obtained with a needle or through a small incision. Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin. Treatment for lupus depends on your signs and symptoms. Determining whether your signs and symptoms should be treated and what medications to use requires a careful discussion of the benefits and risks with your doctor. As your signs and symptoms flare and subside, you and your doctor may find that you&aposll need to change medications or dosages. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems. - Antimalarial drugs. Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications. - Corticosteroids. Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy. - Immunosuppressants. Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and methotrexate (Trexall). Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer. - Biologics. A different type of medication, belimumab (Benlysta) administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea and infections. Rarely, worsening of depression can occur. - Rituximab (Rituxan) can be beneficial in cases of resistant lupus. Side effects include allergic reaction to the intravenous infusion and infections. Take steps to care for your body if you have lupus. Simple measures can help you prevent lupus flares and, should they occur, better cope with the signs and symptoms you experience. Try to: - See your doctor regularly. Having regular checkups instead of only seeing your doctor when your symptoms worsen may help your doctor prevent flare-ups, and can be useful in addressing routine health concerns, such as stress, diet and exercise that can be helpful in preventing lupus complications. - Be sun smart. Because ultraviolet light can trigger a flare, wear protective clothing - such as a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants - and use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 55 every time you go outside. - Get regular exercise. Exercise can help keep your bones strong, reduce your risk of heart attack and promote general well-being. - Don&apost smoke. Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and can worsen the effects of lupus on your heart and blood vessels. - Eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sometimes you may have dietary restrictions, especially if you have high blood pressure, kidney damage or gastrointestinal problems. - Ask your doctor if you need vitamin D and calcium supplements. There is some evidence to suggest that people with lupus may benefit from supplemental vitamin D. A 1,200- to 1,500-milligram calcium supplement taken daily may help keep your bones healthy. Sometimes people with lupus seek alternative or complementary medicine. However, there aren&apost any alternative therapies that have been shown to alter the course of lupus, although some may help ease symptoms of the disease. Discuss these treatments with your doctor before initiating them on your own. He or she can help you weigh the benefits and risks and tell you if the treatments will interfere adversely with your current lupus medications. Complementary and alternative treatments for lupus include: - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Supplements containing this hormone may help fatigue and muscle pain. It may lead to acne in women. - Fish oil. Fish oil supplements contain omega-3 fatty acids that may be beneficial for people with lupus. Preliminary studies have found some promise, though more study is needed. Side effects of fish oil supplements can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. - Acupuncture. This therapy uses tiny needles inserted just under the skin. It may help ease the muscle pain associated with lupus.

Best, NAME	Lupus and Kidney Disease (Lupus Nephritis) (Who gets lupus?): Lupus is much more common in women than in men and most often strikes during the child-bearing years. Nine out of 10 people who have lupus are women. Lupus is also more common in people of African or Asian background. African Americans and Asian Americans are about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop lupus than Caucasians.1 In the United States, 1 out of every 250 African American women will develop lupus.2
-0.714285714286	lupus. Hi, I want to know about Lupus and its treatment. Best, NAME	Lupus nephritis: Lupus nephritis is a kidney disorder which is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body&aposs immune system. Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues. SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead lead to disorders such as interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis. Over time, kidney failure can result. Symptoms of lupus nephritis include: - Blood in the urine - Foamy appearance to urine - High blood pressure - Swelling of any area of the body A physical exam shows signs of decreased kidney functioning with body swelling (edema). Blood pressure may be high. Abnormal sounds may be heard when the doctor listens to your heart and lungs. Tests that may be done include: - ANA titer - BUN and creatinine - Complement levels - Urinalysis - Urine protein - Kidney biopsy, to determine appropriate treatment The goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure. Medicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine. You may need dialysis to control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney. How well you do, depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis. You may have flare-ups, and then times when you do not have any symptoms. Some people with this condition develop chronic kidney failure. Although lupus nephritis may return in a transplanted kidney, it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. Complications that may result from lupus nephritis include: - Acute renal failure - Chronic renal failure Call your health care provider if you have blood in the urine or swelling of your body. If you have lupus nephritis, call your provider if you notice decreased urine output. Treating lupus may help prevent or delay onset of lupus nephritis.

2.0	Medical Diagnosis of Asbestosis. My doctors hint that I have asbestosis but do not say I have asbestosis. All the medical information that I have read from the CDC, Medlin and NIH all say that the symptoms presented are related to a high level of asbestos. Why won&apost the doctor say it?	Asbestosis (Diagnosis): Asbestosis can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms are similar to those of many other types of respiratory diseases. A variety of diagnostic tests might be needed to help pinpoint the diagnosis. Imaging tests - Chest X-ray. Advanced asbestosis appears as excessive whiteness in your lung tissue. If the asbestosis is severe, the tissue in both lungs might be affected, giving them a honeycomb appearance. - Computerized tomography (CT). CT scans combine a series of X-ray views taken from many different angles to produce cross-sectional images of the bones and soft tissues inside your body. These scans generally provide greater detail and might help detect asbestosis in its early stages, even before it shows up on a chest X-ray. Pulmonary function tests These tests determine how well your lungs are functioning. Pulmonary function tests measure how much air your lungs can hold and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you might be asked to blow as hard as you can into an air-measurement device called a spirometer. More-complete pulmonary function tests can measure the amount of oxygen being transferred to your bloodstream.

Do you have information about Doctor of osteopathic medicine: Summary : A doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) is a physician licensed to practice medicine, perform surgery, and prescribe medication. Information : Like all allopathic physicians (or MDs), osteopathic physicians complete 4 years of medical school and can choose to practice in any specialty of medicine. However, osteopathic physicians receive an additional 300 to 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body&aposs musculoskeletal system. Osteopathic physicians hold to the principle that a patient&aposs history of illness and physical trauma are written into the body&aposs structure. The osteopathic physician&aposs highly developed sense of touch allows the physician to feel (palpitate) the patient&aposs living anatomy (the flow of fluids, motion and texture of tissues, and structural makeup). Like MDs, osteopathic physicians are licensed at the state level. Osteopathic physicians who wish to specialize may become board certified (in the same manner as MDs) by completing a 2- to 6-year residency within the specialty area and passing the board certification exams. DOs practice in all specialties of medicine, ranging from emergency medicine and cardiovascular surgery to psychiatry and geriatrics. A majority of osteopathic doctors use many of the medical and surgical treatments that are used by other medical doctors.

Asbestosis: Asbestosis (as-bes-TOE-sis) is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. Prolonged exposure to these fibers can cause lung tissue scarring and shortness of breath. Asbestosis symptoms can range from mild to severe, and usually don&apost appear until many years after continued exposure. Asbestos is a natural mineral product that&aposs resistant to heat and corrosion. It was used extensively in the past in products such as insulation, cement and some floor tiles. Most people with asbestosis acquired it on the job before the federal government began regulating the use of asbestos and asbestos products in the 1970s. Today, its handling is strictly regulated. Acquiring asbestosis is extremely unlikely if you follow your employer&aposs safety procedures. Treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms. The effects of long-term exposure to asbestos typically don&apost show up for 10 to 40 years after initial exposure. Asbestosis signs and symptoms can include: - Shortness of breath - A persistent, dry cough - Loss of appetite with weight loss - Fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than normal (clubbing) - Chest tightness or pain When to see a doctor If you have a history of exposure to asbestos and you&aposre experiencing increasing shortness of breath, talk to your doctor about the possibility of asbestosis. If you are exposed to high levels of asbestos dust over a long period of time, some of the airborne fibers can become lodged within your alveoli - the tiny sacs inside your lungs where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in your blood. The asbestos fibers irritate and scar lung tissue, causing the lungs to become stiff. This makes it difficult to breathe. As asbestosis progresses, more and more lung tissue becomes scarred. Eventually, your lung tissue becomes so stiff that it can&apost contract and expand normally. Smoking cigarettes appears to increase the retention of asbestos fibers in the lungs, and often results in a faster progression of the disease. People who worked in mining, milling, manufacturing, installation or removal of asbestos products before the late 1970s are at risk of asbestosis. Examples include: - Asbestos miners - Aircraft and auto mechanics - Boiler operators - Building construction workers - Electricians - Railroad workers - Shipyard workers - Workers removing asbestos insulation around steam pipes in older buildings In general, it&aposs safe to be around materials that are made with asbestos as long as the asbestos fibers are contained. This prevents them from getting into the air. If you have asbestosis, you&aposre at increased risk of developing lung cancer - especially if you smoke or have a history of smoking. Asbestosis can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms are similar to those of many other types of respiratory diseases.

More-complete pulmonary function tests can measure the amount of oxygen being transferred to your bloodstream. There&aposs no treatment to reverse the effects of asbestos on the alveoli. Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and relieving symptoms. You&aposll need routine follow-up care, such as chest X-rays and lung function tests, at regular intervals depending on the severity of your condition. Therapy To ease breathing difficulty caused by advanced asbestosis, your doctor might prescribe supplemental oxygen. This is delivered by thin plastic tubing with prongs that fit into your nostrils or a mask. Surgery If your symptoms are severe, you might be a candidate for a lung transplant. - Stop smoking. Asbestosis increases the risk of lung cancer. Quitting smoking can reduce this risk. Try to avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking might also cause emphysema, which further reduces your lung reserves. - Get vaccinated. Talk to your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines, which can help lower your risk of lung infections. Promptly treat respiratory infections.

Facts About Age-Related Macular Degeneration (How is AMD detected?): The early and intermediate stages of AMD usually start without symptoms. Only a comprehensive dilated eye exam can detect AMD. The eye exam may include the following: Visual acuity test. This eye chart measures how well you see at distances. Dilated eye exam. Your eye care professional places drops in your eyes to widen or dilate the pupils. This provides a better view of the back of your eye. Using a special magnifying lens, he or she then looks at your retina and optic nerve for signs of AMD and other eye problems. Amsler grid. Your eye care professional also may ask you to look at an Amsler grid. Changes in your central vision may cause the lines in the grid to disappear or appear wavy, a sign of AMD. Fluorescein angiogram. In this test, which is performed by an ophthalmologist, a fluorescent dye is injected into your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your eye. This makes it possible to see leaking blood vessels, which occur in a severe, rapidly progressive type of AMD (see below). In rare cases, complications to the injection can arise, from nausea to more severe allergic reactions. Optical coherence tomography. You have probably heard of ultrasound, which uses sound waves to capture images of living tissues. OCT is similar except that it uses light waves, and can achieve very high-resolution images of any tissues that can be penetrated by light-such as the eyes. After your eyes are dilated, you&aposll be asked to place your head on a chin rest and hold still for several seconds while the images are obtained. The light beam is painless. During the exam, your eye care professional will look for drusen , which are yellow deposits beneath the retina. Most people develop some very small drusen as a normal part of aging. The presence of medium-to-large drusen may indicate that you have AMD. Another sign of AMD is the appearance of pigmentary changes under the retina. In addition to the pigmented cells in the iris (the colored part of the eye), there are pigmented cells beneath the retina. As these cells break down and release their pigment, your eye care professional may see dark clumps of released pigment and later, areas that are less pigmented. These changes will not affect your eye color. Questions to ask your eye care Professional Below are a few questions you may want to ask your eye care professional to help you understand your diagnosis and treatment. If you do not understand your eye care professional&aposs responses, ask questions until you do understand. What is my diagnosis and how do you spell the name of the condition? Can my AMD be treated? How will this condition affect my vision now and in the future? What symptoms should I watch for and how should I notify you if they occur? Should I make lifestyle changes?

Screen time and children: "Screen time" is a term used for activities done in front of a screen, such as watching TV, working on a computer, or playing video games. Screen time is sedentary activity, meaning you are being physically inactive while sitting down. Very little energy is used during screen time. Most American children spend about 3 hours a day watching TV. Added together, all types of screen time can total 5 to 7 hours a day. Too much screen time can: Make it hard for your child to sleep at night Raise your child&aposs risk for attention problems, anxiety, and depression Raise your child&aposs risk for gaining too much weight (obesity) Screen time increases your child&aposs risk for obesity because: Sitting and watching a screen is time that is not spent being physically active. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices. Most of the time, the foods in ads that are aimed at kids are high in sugar, salt, or fats. Children eat more when they are watching TV, especially if they see ads for food. Computers can help kids with their schoolwork. But surfing the internet, spending too much time on Facebook, or watching YouTube videos is considered unhealthy screen time. Children under age 2 should have no screen time. Limit screen time to 1 to 2 hours a day for children over age 2. Despite what ads may say, videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development. Cutting down to 2 hours a day can be hard for some children because TV may be such a large part of their daily routines. But you can help your children by telling them how sedentary activities affect their overall health. Talk to them about things they can do to be healthier. To decrease screen time: Remove the TV or computer from your child&aposs bedroom. DO NOT allow TV watching during meals or homework. DO NOT let your child eat while watching TV or using the computer. DO NOT leave the TV on for background noise. Turn on the radio instead, or have no background noise. Decide which programs to watch ahead of time. Turn off the TV when those programs are over. Suggest other activities, such as family board games, puzzles, or going for a walk. Keep a record of how much time is spent in front of a screen. Try to spend the same amount of time being active. Be a good role model as a parent. Decrease your own screen time to 2 hours a day. If it is hard not having the TV on, try using a sleep function so it turns off automatically. Challenge your family to go 1 week without watching TV or doing other screen-time activities. Find things to do with your time that get you moving and burning energy. Updated by: Liora C.
